Timothy F Geithner: Developments in the global economy and implications for
the United States

Bank of New York, at the Council on Foreign Relations' C Peter McColough Roundtable Series on
International Economics, New York, 11 January 2007.

It is a pleasure to be here at the Council on Foreign Relations, and to be here with Jerry Corrigan.
A few brief remarks about the global economy, both the real and financial dimensions, to provide a
basis for our discussion.
2006 marked the fourth successive year of a global expansion that has been remarkable for its
strength, for its breadth, and for its stability in the face of economic shocks and uncertainty in the
geopolitical realm.
This period of broad-based growth in income has been supported by a number of important
fundamental forces.
Rapid technological innovation and greater economic integration have brought stronger growth and
higher levels of productivity. The acceleration in productivity growth that occurred in the United States
in the second half of the last decade seems likely to remain intact. And productivity growth is
accelerating outside the United States, most strikingly in some of the large emerging economies.
Financial innovation and greater integration of national financial systems has contributed to the
strength of real economic activity by improving the allocation of resources within and among
economies. Improvements to risk management and to capital cushions are likely to have made the
financial system more stable and more resilient.
And macroeconomic policy has improved around the world. The increase in monetary policy credibility
in a broad range of countries has produced lower rates of inflation and more stability in inflation
expectations. Greater public confidence in monetary policy was critical to laying the foundation for the
improvements in real economic performance, by providing a stable foundation for long-term
investment decisions.
In emerging markets, better monetary policy has been accompanied by more disciplined and
conservative fiscal policy and a range of other policies that have reduced, though not eliminated,
vulnerability to changes in confidence, capital flows and exchange rate movements.
These factors are each fundamentally important, and they are, of course, interrelated. The policies that
delivered better inflation outcomes, more openness and competition and stronger financial systems
were critical to fostering an environment in which improvements in productivity and growth could
occur.
This expansion has also been notable for the financial conditions that have prevailed over the past
several years.
Long-term interest rates have remained relatively low in nominal and real terms. Equity and other
asset prices have moved higher. Credit spreads have declined to quite low levels. Market participants
report exceptionally high levels of liquidity. And volatility, both realized and expected, has remained
low across many different types of financial assets, market and economies.
This general constellation of market conditions and asset prices is unusual, at least in comparison to
what we have seen over the past several decades. This has been a distinguishing feature of the
present expansion, but it is not something we fully understand, and we cannot be confident in
judgments about how durable it will prove to be.
To a significant extent, these financial developments reflect a high degree of confidence in future
macroeconomic and financial stability, reinforced by the improvements in inflation performance, growth
outcomes and financial resilience of the past several years.
Better monetary policy has lowered expectations of future inflation and inflation volatility and has
contributed to lower risk premiums in general. Changes in the cyclical behavior of financial

intermediation and credit provision, coupled with the increased stability of the real economy, seem
likely to have reinforced the improvements on the monetary policy front.
And rapid growth in the major emerging market economies, together with the substantial earnings of
energy-producing and commodity-exporting countries, have produced a substantial increase in wealth
and savings relative to perceived investment opportunities. In a world where capital can now flow
much more freely across national borders, a significant portion of these savings has moved across
national borders.
These are powerful and fundamental forces, and they certainly help explain the broad reduction in risk
premiums and the substantial demand for credit risk and financial assets.
There are other factors at work as well, however, that have less favorable implications. Part of this
recent dynamic in financial markets is a consequence of the present state of the international
monetary system, in which a substantial part of the world economy runs exchange rate regimes tied in
some way to the dollar. This has entailed a sustained period of very substantial official accumulation of
dollar reserves, putting downward pressure on U.S. interest rates and upward pressure on U.S. asset
prices.
These forces are surely transitory, but their impact on capital flows, interest rates and asset prices are
important, not just in terms of their short-term impact on growth. If they are large enough, they have
the potential to alter or distort current decisions about investment and consumption in a way that could
be detrimental to our longer-run growth prospects. And they are important because they work to mask
or dampen the effects on risk premiums in financial markets that we might otherwise expect to be
associated with the expected trajectory of the fiscal and external imbalances in the United States.
Given this broad context, I want to touch briefly on some of the policy issues that are likely to be
important to the prospects for economic performance, here and around the world. Despite the
relatively favorable performance of the global economy, we face a range of daunting longer-term
economic policy challenges. The improvements in the conduct of monetary policy were critical to the
improvements in productivity and growth that we are now seeing on a global scale. And monetary
policy will, of course, continue to be critical, but monetary policy alone cannot provide the elements of
the framework necessary to provide an environment for innovation and long-term decisions that will be
so vital for future growth. Economic policy, in general, needs to be more forward looking in providing a
longer-term framework for stability.
On the fiscal policy front, demographic changes confront governments around the world with
exceptionally difficult choices. For the United States, these challenges are less acute than for many of
the major economies, but they are still formidable in their scale and complexity. Even for the near term
- for the period before the increase in number of retirees starts to have a major impact on Social
Security and Medicare expenditures - we are running an unsustainably large fiscal deficit. Despite the
recent improvements in revenues, the expected trajectory for the fiscal deficit will mean that federal
government debt will continue to rise as a share of GDP. The restoration of fiscal rules - such as those
that require new tax cuts or expenditure programs to be funded with offsetting policy measures - will
help reduce the risk of further deterioration. However, they need to be complemented by a consensus
on policy changes that will produce smaller future deficits.
Restoring confidence in U.S. fiscal management would be important and necessary independent of
the broader context of the global economy today, but it is more important given the size of our external
imbalance, now running at the unprecedented level of 7 percent of GDP a year. The trade balance in
real terms has been broadly stable over the past two years, but our net income payments have shifted
to deficit, and the size of that component of the current account deficit seems likely to continue to
expand. These large global imbalances, our current account deficit and the surpluses that are the
counterpart to our deficit, will have to come down over time. How that process unfolds will depend on a
complex mix of factors around the world. Confidence that the U.S. political system will act to generate
a sustainable fiscal trajectory is important to raising the probability that this process of adjustment
unfolds with less risk.
A successful conclusion of the Doha round of trade negotiations would provide some insurance
against the risk that the process of economic integration will be interrupted or reversed. Despite the
relatively favorable average income gains of the past few years, a common feature of the political
context in economies around the world is the fragility or weakness of public support for openness and
economic integration.

2

BIS Review 2/2007

The political challenge of sustaining support for the process of integration may be the most important
economic challenge of our time. To paraphrase Lawrence Summers, it is not enough to explain that
globalization is inevitable and that policies that look politically attractive as a response to economic
anxiety will only hurt the economy as a whole. Nor is it a politically effective strategy to state simply
that economic integration is a necessary and powerful force in raising average incomes, or that
technological change may be more important than trade or immigration as an explanation for slower
growth in real wages for many Americans.
Raising the quality of education and exploring ways to improve the safety net are a necessary part of
the solution to this challenge. But these reforms will have a long fuse and they may not yield the
hoped-for increase in support. Trade does not appear to be more popular in countries with more
generous safety nets, universal health care and highly subsidized higher education than it is today in
the United States.
The political challenges of sustaining support for global economic integration and fiscal sustainability
will be more difficult in the United States because of what has happened to the distribution of income
and economic insecurity. Several broad economic forces substantially complicate an already difficult
set of political challenges: the long-term increase in income inequality, the slow pace of growth in real
wages for the middle quintiles of the population, the increase in the volatility of income that is a
reflection of the greater flexibility of the U.S. economy, and the greater exposure of households to the
risk in financing retirement and the burden of paying for health care.
More generally, the global financial system and the monetary arrangements that underpin it are in the
process of a delicate and consequential transition as the major emerging market economies particularly in Asia - move toward more mature monetary policy frameworks, more flexible exchange
rate regimes and more open capital markets. This transition will require careful management, and the
economic dimensions of getting it right would be complicated even without the political pressures
those governments face.
One final note on the financial system. The global financial system is in the process of very dramatic
change. The changes of even just the last five years are extraordinary, in terms of the size, and
strength, and scope of the major global firms, the role of private leveraged funds, the extent of risk
transfer and the increase in the size of the derivatives market, the change in the structure of the credit
market, the increase in and changes in the pattern of cross border financial flows.
These changes, and others, seem likely to have made the financial system both more effective in
moving capital to its most productive use and more stable and resilient over time. But they do not, of
course, mean the end of systemic risk in financial markets. They could in some circumstances work to
magnify rather than mitigate stress. Central banks, supervisors and those running the major private
financial institutions need to continue to work to ensure that what Jerry Corrigan calls the “shock
absorbers” in the financial system - capital and liquidity and the operational infrastructure - are
sufficiently strong and robust to withstand economic and financial conditions more adverse than we
have seen in the recent past.
Thank you.

Timothy F Geithner: Liquidity and financial markets
Keynote address by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, at the 8th Annual Risk Convention and Exhibition, Global Association of
Risk Professionals, New York, 28 February 2007.

We have been in a period that market participants have characterized as one of exceptional liquidity.
This is both a reflection of, and has contributed to, the ongoing expansion in the world economy. I
want to focus my remarks today on the role of liquidity in markets, and what supervisors and market
participants can do to make markets more robust against the shocks that we know will occur from time
to time. These remarks are directed to a general phenomenon related to developments in the financial
markets in recent years, and not to the specific conditions of the moment.
Liquidity plays a central role in the functioning of financial markets. Structural changes in the financial
system that have been underway for some time increase the importance of market liquidity. The
allocation of capital increasingly relies on securities markets, where funds for investment in the real
economy are raised through the direct issuance of securities to investors. A greater diversity of
financial institutions, institutions other than banks, now play a more active role in the provision of credit
and liquidity.
Liquidity can mean many different things. One dimension of liquidity is the availability of credit or the
ease with which institutions can borrow or take on leverage. This is generally referred to as funding
liquidity.
Another dimension of liquidity is the ease with which market participants can transact, or the ability of
markets to absorb large purchases or sales without much effect on prices. This is what is generally
called market liquidity.
Although these two concepts are distinct, they are closely related and are often mutually reinforcing.
Fundamentally this is so because when funding liquidity is abundant traders have the resources with
which to finance trading positions that smooth price shocks and make markets liquid.
In practice, this mutually reinforcing behavior is driven by a complex array of factors, including the
degree of leverage embedded in the markets at any given time, the difficulty that lenders face in
discerning whether a surge in volatility is driven by a transitory shock of some kind or a permanent
shock to fundamentals, and risk management practices.
Institutions manage the credit risk in their trading-related exposure by requiring some counterparties to
post collateral or margin. Typically, institutions require of hedge fund counterparties both initial margin
against potential loss and variation margin, which requires payment to cover any decline in the value
of the position. If the position declines in value, the counterparty will have to meet margin calls. If it
does not have enough liquidity on hand to meet those calls, it will have to liquidate other positions to
raise the requisite cash. The failure to satisfy such a margin call could lead to the liquidation of the
position.
This approach to risk management can transform credit risk into liquidity risk. In most circumstances,
the impact of this is unexceptional. Other institutions will find the new prices attractive and step in and
buy. In exceptional circumstances, however, as creditors and counterparties seek to reduce their
exposure to future losses, actions intended to limit individual exposure to risk may instead increase
overall risk.
We do not know very much about what makes markets more or less vulnerable to this type of acute
shock. This is in part because liquidity itself is not easy to measure.
A broad range of indicators tells us something about funding liquidity, including growth in monetary
aggregates, in financial assets and different forms of borrowing or credit. Other measures, such as
movements in bid-ask spreads, the level of interest rates, changes in asset prices and risk premia,
along with the level of volatility and expectations of future volatility, and turnover volume or other
measures of market depth, help us evaluate market liquidity.
Yet none of the measures provides a reliable way of judging how vulnerable markets are to a reversal,
or the scale of damage that might accompany a reversal.

BIS Review 19/2007

These measurement limitations are similar to those that make it difficult to judge when, and by what
magnitude, asset prices deviate from fundamental values at any given point in time.
In the case of liquidity, the shortcomings of our analytical tools are magnified by the difficulty of
measuring leverage or identifying potential concentrations in the financial system. This has always
been challenging, but the growth in the overall size of private pools of capital and the degree of
embedded leverage that exists in many derivative instruments makes this more challenging today.
When market liquidity and funding seem abundant, this is likely to be observable in things we can
measure, like interest rates and credit spreads. And when liquidity ebbs, the effect is conspicuous in a
range of observable market prices and volumes. But we do not have, and probably never will have, a
set of indicators that offers the promise of predicting when liquidity conditions will reverse, or when
markets are particularly vulnerable to a more acute decline in liquidity.
In this sense, liquidity is like confidence. And, like confidence, liquidity plays a critical role both in
establishing the conditions than can lead to a financial shock, and in determining whether that shock
becomes acute, threatening broader damage to the functioning of financial and credit markets.
What role can policy play in reducing the vulnerability of markets to this type of dynamic?
Of course, central banks have a range of instruments they can use in the event of a crisis. By injecting
liquidity into the system, and thus strengthening confidence, they can reduce the risk that temporary
liquidity problems will result in default by otherwise solvent institutions, or damage to the payment
system or credit process.
But what can policy makers do ex ante to limit the risk of crisis? The most powerful instruments we
have are those that affect the strength of the basic, fundamental shock absorbers in the financial
system. When capital and liquidity cushions at the major institutions are strong, then markets as a
whole are less vulnerable to the adverse spiral of asset price declines, increased volatility, and
declining liquidity. And when the operational infrastructure is robust, markets will be able to absorb
larger shocks and sharper changes in risk appetite with less risk of broader contagion. These shock
absorbers are substantially stronger today than they have been in even in the relatively recent past.
These issues are the principal focus of day-to-day supervision and market oversight in the major
financial centers around the world. The Federal Reserve is actively involved in a range of efforts,
working closely with the primary supervisors of the major global financial institutions and the critical
parts of the financial infrastructure, to encourage further progress.
In this context, we are working to put in place a stronger regulatory capital regime and to strengthen
the capacity of firms to absorb losses in stress conditions. We are encouraging more sophisticated
and more conservative management of credit exposures in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and
structured financial products, as well as of exposures to hedge funds. And we are encouraging a
range of efforts to modernize the operational infrastructure that underpins the OTC derivatives
markets, and to improve the capacity of market participants to manage adversity.
These efforts will all contribute to a more resilient system, one that is better able to withstand the
effects of a major decline in asset prices or deterioration in credit.
Are there other tools that policy makers and market participants could use to address this risk?
Some policy makers have argued that public disclosure of information could help reduce the risk of
future systemic financial crisis, by preventing the buildup of "excessive" leverage or concentrations of
risk.
The principal focus of attention, as in the immediate wake of the failure of Long Term Capital
Management, has been on two quite different types of public disclosure.
The first is information that would make it easier to evaluate the overall leverage or risk profile of major
hedge funds and their counterparties, and thereby judge their vulnerability to a sharp movement in
asset prices. The second is information about the actual positions of individual funds or institutions:
information that would make it easier to identify concentrated exposures to specific risk factors, and
thereby assess more accurately the potential impact of the failure of a major fund or institutions on the
market as a whole.
These pose very different challenges and offer different benefits. There are a number of crude
measures of overall risk profile that, if disclosed to the market, would give counterparties information
they do not now typically get about the risk of failure of the fund. One example is data on the size of

2

BIS Review 19/2007

daily variations in net asset value, VAR, or profit and loss over the previous quarter. This type of
information would not reveal proprietary information about trading strategies or otherwise create
substantial disincentives to risk taking. Although these would provide some information on the overall
risk profile of the fund, they would be lagging indicators, and they would carry the usual risk of
providing false comfort in some circumstances and excessive concern in others.
Adopting such measures would give the institutions that provide financing and leverage to hedge
funds a somewhat greater capacity to judge their direct risk to those funds. But that is not their
principal challenge. The institutions already know the positions they are financing, and they can use
the usual range of tools to measure the potential exposure, net of collateral, in those positions. And
where they do not feel they have adequate information to evaluate the overall risk profile of the fund,
they can manage that risk by taking less exposure, by requiring more margin, or by building a greater
cushion of protection against overall risk. So the potential gains from a disclosure regime of this type
would be limited, at least as compared with the cost of trying to put such a regime in place on the
global scale that would be necessary to make it effective.
By far the greater challenge is to assess the potential impact of the failure of a major hedge fund on
the firm's other exposures and other counterparties. This is a question about how correlated the firms
other positions are to the risks the hedge fund is taking. It goes beyond the firm's direct credit
exposure to the hedge fund, to the fund's overall risk profile. Large hedge funds typically use multiple
prime brokers, and they are, of course, reluctant to disclose to those institutions real time information
on their overall positions and trading strategies. So the banks and investment banks do not generally
know what their overall exposure to credit and market risks might be in the event that a large fund is
forced to liquidate positions.
This knowledge gap has led many to advocate the provision of information on actual positions of the
major funds, perhaps aggregated by a third party. According to the proponents, this would help market
participants and regulators to identify potential concentrations or crowded trades, and that knowledge
would help diffuse them before they became a problem.
This type of transparency has understandable and enduring appeal, but it is unachievable. There is no
feasible way to try to capture in real time the rapidly changing exposures of different institutions to
different risks in any meaningful fashion. No one with access to that information could make sensible
judgments about the level and nature of actual concentrations and whether the risks are excessive.
We continue to explore ways in which the provision of greater information to counterparties and to the
markets more generally could help reduce vulnerability to financial crises. For now, though, the
practical limitations on achieving greater transparency underscore the importance strengthening the
robustness of the shock absorbers in the financial system. We are not likely to ever be in a position
where we have the capacity to identify the source and estimate the probability of future financial
shocks. And policy makers are unlikely to ever be in a position to diffuse concentrations of risk or
crowded trades ahead of a crisis. The most sensible thing we can do is to improve the capacity of the
core of the financial system to handle adversity, and this requires continued focus on improving the
strength of the capital and liquidity cushions, as well as the market infrastructure.
Let me end with a few quick thoughts on the role of monetary policy in this context. Can monetary
policy play a pre-emptive role in reducing the vulnerability of financial markets to the type of dynamic
we saw in 1987 and 1998?
Central banks cannot realistically hold out the prospect of using monetary policy to prevent asset price
bubbles, conditions of "excess" leverage in parts of the financial system, or other factors in markets
that might lead to the types of positive feedback dynamics that were at the heart of some past crises.
And yet many of the observations made about liquidity and market conditions over recent years have
potential implications for monetary policy. Changes in risk premia, the level of asset prices, credit
spreads, and interest rates, and in realized and expected volatility of asset prices – these can all affect
the pace at which overall demand grows, and can therefore potentially affect future inflation.
In discharging their responsibilities for the maintenance of price stability, central bankers need to be
eclectic in looking at a range of different ways of measuring the stance of monetary policy, and its
effects on the future path of growth and inflation. No indicators of liquidity or overall financial conditions
provide a ready guide to judgments about monetary policy. But all these indicators merit careful
attention, and they strengthen the argument against narrow or mechanistic approaches to thinking
about the monetary and broader economic outlook.

BIS Review 19/2007

Ultimately, though, ex ante judgments about leverage, concentrations and liquidity risk will continue to
prove elusive. Our principal focus should therefore be not in the search for the capacity to
preemptively diffuse conditions of excess leverage or liquidity, but in improving the capacity of the core
of the financial system to withstand shocks and on mitigating the impact of those shocks. And, as
always, central banks need to stand prepared to make appropriate monetary policy adjustments if
changes in financial conditions would otherwise threaten the achievement of the goals of price stability
and sustainable economic growth.
Thank you.

Timothy F Geithner: Credit markets innovations and their implications
Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, at the 2007 Credit Markets Symposium hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Richmond, Charlotte, North Carolina, 23 March 2007.
*

I am grateful to Jeff Lacker for including me in this conference, and my compliments to him and the
Richmond Fed for bringing together an excellent group to discuss the implications of recent
innovations in credit markets.
The past few years have seen remarkable changes in credit markets, and this is a good time to take
stock of what we know about those developments and their implications.
The latest wave of credit market innovations has elicited some concerns about their implications for
the stability of the financial system, concerns similar to those associated with earlier periods of rapid
change in financial markets. Will the most recent credit market innovations amplify credit cycles,
contributing to "excessive" lending in times of relative stability, and then magnify the contraction in
credit that follows? Will they introduce greater volatility in financial markets? Will they create greater
risk of systemic financial crisis?
These concerns have been heightened in some quarters by the problems currently being experienced
in the subprime mortgage sector. It will take some time before the full implications are understood and
the full impact can be assessed. As of now, though, there are few signs that the disruptions in this one
sector of the credit markets will have a lasting impact on credit markets as a whole.
Indeed, economic theory and recent practical experience offer some reassurance against both these
specific concerns and more general worries about the implications of credit market innovations for the
performance of the financial system.
The rapid growth in these new types of credit instruments is, of course, a sign of their value to market
participants. For borrowers, credit market innovation offers the prospect of increased credit supply;
better pricing; and a relaxation of financial constraints. For investors, new credit instruments bring the
prospect of broader risk and return opportunities; the ability to diversify portfolios; and increased
flexibility. And for lenders, innovations can help free up funding and capital for other uses; they can
help improve credit risk and asset/liability management; and they can improve the return on capital
and provide new and cheaper funding sources.
By spreading risk more broadly, providing opportunities to manage and hedge risk, and making it
possible to trade and price credit risk, credit market innovation should help make markets both more
efficient and more resilient. They should help make markets better able to allocate capital to its highest
return and better able to absorb stress. Broad, deep and well-functioning capital markets
complemented by strong, well-capitalized banks, able to provide liquidity in times of strain, make for a
more efficient financial system: one which contributes to better economic growth outcomes over time.
There are therefore compelling arguments in favor of a generally positive assessment of the
consequences of innovation. Does experience provide support for these arguments, or are these
changes too new for us to know?
The recent changes in credit markets have been dramatic. We have seen rapid growth of structured
credit products, credit default swaps and new types of collateralized debt and loan obligations.
Although these instruments are very new, they are the natural extension of earlier innovations in credit
markets. Over a long period we have seen innovations ranging from the syndication of bank loans and
the direct provision of credit through the capital markets, to the spread of asset-backed securities and
products that separate different parts of the payments stream and different dimensions of the risk in a
credit obligation into different instruments.
These changes have contributed to a substantial reduction in the share of total credit held by banks.
They have produced a greater separation or distance between the entity that first arranges a loan and
those who end up holding the risk, and more intermediaries in that chain. And they have contributed to
a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of creditors to any individual borrower, and a greater
capacity to actively trade credit risk.

BIS Review 29/2007

We are now well into the third decade of experience with the consequences of these earlier
innovations, and this history offers some useful lessons for evaluating the probable impact of the latest
changes in credit markets.
The ease with which the U.S. financial system absorbed the substantial scale of corporate defaults
that peaked in recent years in 2002 provides some support for the argument that broader and deeper
capital markets make the system more resilient.
In general, there does not seem to be strong empirical support for the proposition that derivatives
increase volatility in financial markets. Volatility is not higher where derivatives are most prevalent.
Credit market innovation does not appear to have resulted in a large increase in leverage in the
corporate sector, as some had feared. Indeed, nonfinancial corporate leverage in the United States is
currently low by recent historical standards. The overall degree of balance sheet leverage by
corporations, for example, is higher in some more traditional financial systems than it is in systems
where credit market innovations are more advanced.
Default rates do not appear to have risen, nor recovery rates fallen as these credit innovations have
spread, despite concerns they might lead to excess lending, the mis-pricing of credit risk and more
messy and more complicated workouts, resulting from the greater diffusion of the investor base.
And although the sources of the broad moderation in GDP volatility observed in the United States over
the past two decades are still the subject of debate, the fact that this moderation occurred during a
period of extensive innovation in credit and other financial markets should provide some comfort for
those who expected the opposite.
Innovations in credit markets are inevitably accompanied by challenges. Indeed, the history of
innovation in financial markets provides many examples of periods of rapid change accompanied by
fraud and abuse, by challenges in assessing value and risk, by concerns about the adequacy of
investor and consumer protection, and by unexpected behavior of prices, defaults and correlations. To
some degree, these types of problems are the inevitable consequence of change and innovation.
Although recent experience as well as theory provide some reassurance against the concern that
credit market innovation would make markets more volatile and the financial system more vulnerable,
these judgments require qualification. Some aspects of this latest wave of innovation are different in
substance – therefore potentially in their implications – from their predecessors. And these differences
require attention.
There are three aspects of the latest set of changes which I think deserve more reflection.
The first is about the role of market liquidity and liquidity risk in how credit markets work. Credit market
innovations have transformed the financial system from one in which most credit risk is in the form of
loans, held to maturity on the balance sheets of banks, to a system in which most credit risk now takes
an incredibly diverse array of different forms, much of it held by nonbank financial institutions that mark
to market and can take on substantial leverage.
U.S. financial institutions now hold only around 15 percent of total credit outstanding by the nonfarm
nonfinancial sector: that is less than half the level of two decades ago. For the largest U.S. banks,
credit exposures in over-the-counter derivatives is approaching the level of more traditional forms of
credit exposure. Hedge funds, according to one recent survey, account for 58 percent of the volume in
credit derivatives in the year to the first quarter of 2006.
Financial shocks take many forms. Some, such as in 1987 and 1998, involve a sharp increase in risk
premia that precipitate a fall in asset prices and that in turn leads to what economists and engineers
call "positive feedback" dynamics. As firms and investors move to hedge against future losses and to
raise money to meet margin calls, the brake becomes the accelerator: markets come under additional
pressure, pushing asset prices lower. Volatility increases. Liquidity in markets for more risky assets
falls.
In systems where credit is more market-based and more credit risk is in leveraged financial institutions
outside the banking system, a sharp rise in asset-price volatility and the concomitant reduction in
market liquidity, can potentially have greater negative effects on credit markets. If losses in these
institutions force them to withdraw from credit markets, credit availability will decline, unless or until
other institutions in a stronger financial position are willing to step in. The greater connection between
asset-price volatility, market liquidity and the credit mechanism is the necessary consequence of a
system in which credit risk is dispersed outside the banking system, including among leveraged funds.

2

BIS Review 29/2007

This does not make the system less stable, though, only different. For if risk is spread more broadly,
shocks should be absorbed with less trauma. Moreover, the system as a whole may be less
vulnerable to distortions introduced by the moral hazard associated with the access that banks have to
the safety net.
A second issue we need to consider stems from the complexity of the new credit instruments, the
challenges they present in terms of valuation and risk measurement and their short history of
experience in times of stress.
Even the most sophisticated participants in the markets for these instruments find the risk
management challenges associated with these instruments daunting. This raises the prospect of
unanticipated losses. Default rates are harder to predict where there has been a substantial change in
the financial attributes of borrowers. The prices of instruments may not respond as expected to a given
change in losses or in the value of the assets underlying these instruments. Hedging strategies may
prove to be less effective than expected. Similarly rated instruments can behave very differently in
stress events.
The response of prices and volatility to the downgrades in the automobile sector in the spring of 2005
and the recent experience in subprime mortgages and related asset-backed securities and credit
derivatives illustrate different types of surprises faced by the participants in these markets. They are a
reminder of the dimensions of uncertainty that exist about the shape of the distribution of potential
returns. This is particularly true of what we might call the adverse tail, or the negative extreme. These
challenges exist for all participants in these markets: for the institutions that underwrite, structure and
distribute these risks; for those who trade or hold them; and for third parties, like the rating agencies.
These challenges of complexity are significant as well because they can exacerbate the problem of
dealing with classic principal-agent problems. You can see this in the subprime mortgage market
where, for example, a person may be rewarded for generating new mortgages on the basis of volume,
without being directly exposed to the consequences of default; but these problems exist wherever
incentives diverge and contracting is imperfect. Financial institutions typically maintain a range of
different checks and balances to deal with the risk of misaligned incentives: for example, between a
trader and the principal whose resources are at risk, or between the mortgage broker or underwriter
and the firm that ultimately ends up holding the risk. But these checks and balances depend in part on
the capacity of risk managers to observe and understand the underlying economic risk in these
instruments. Where that is harder because of this combination of complexity, imbedded leverage, and
short loss history, then market discipline will be weaker.
A third issue relates to the dynamics of failure and the infrastructure that supports these markets. The
dramatic growth in the volume of over-the-counter derivatives and the growth in the number and size
of leveraged funds inevitably complicate the resolution of the failure of a large financial institution that
is active in these markets. The sheer number of financial contracts that would have to be unraveled in
the context of a default, the challenge that a former colleague of mine likes to refer to as
"unscrambling the eggs," could exacerbate and prolong uncertainty, and complicate the process of
resolution.
As is typical during periods of rapid innovation, these markets grew much more quickly than did the
supporting infrastructure. Take credit derivatives, for example. For most of the early years of this
market, much of the post-trade processing system was not automated and required substantial
manual intervention. Positions were assigned without the knowledge of counterparties. Confirmations
backlogs rose to very high levels. As Alan Greenspan put it, the market was using 19th century
methods of dealing with 21st century financial instruments.
This created a greater risk of operational problems and uncertainty about exposures in the event of
stress. The capacity of market participants to mitigate these risks by improving the infrastructure was
hampered by classic collective action problems, magnified by the greater number and diversity of
participants.
All these challenges merit attention. They describe some of the risks that have accompanied the
substantial benefits of credit market innovation. And they help illustrate why these broad changes in
financial markets may have contributed to a system where the probability of a major crisis seems likely
to be lower, but the losses associated with such a crisis may be greater or harder to mitigate.
What should policymakers to do mitigate these risks?

We cannot turn back the clock on innovation or reverse the increase in complexity around risk
management. We do not have the capacity to monitor or control concentrations of leverage or risk
outside the banking system. We cannot identify the likely sources of future stress to the system, and
act preemptively to diffuse them.
The most productive focus of policy attention has to be on improving the shock absorbers in the core
of the financial system, in terms of capital and liquidity relative to risk and the robustness of the
infrastructure.
These issues are the principal focus of day-to-day supervision and market oversight in the major
financial centers around the world. The Federal Reserve is actively involved in a range of efforts,
working closely with the primary supervisors of the major global financial institutions and the critical
parts of the financial infrastructure, to encourage further progress. In this context, we are working to
put in place a stronger regulatory capital regime and to strengthen the capacity of firms to absorb
losses in stress conditions. We are encouraging more sophisticated and more conservative
management of credit exposures in over-the-counter derivatives and structured financial products, as
well as of exposures to hedge funds. And we are encouraging a range of efforts to modernize the
operational infrastructure that underpins the over-the-counter derivatives markets, and to improve the
capacity of market participants to manage a major default.
The stronger these shock absorbers, the more resilient markets will be in the face of future shocks,
and the more confident we can be that banks will be a source of strength and of liquidity to markets in
periods of stress and that the financial system will contribute to improved economic performance over
time.
Thank you.

Timothy F Geithner: Reflections on the changing global economy
Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, at the 46th ACI Financial Markets Association World Congress, Montreal, Quebec,
4 May 2007.

Good morning. I am pleased to be able to join you today. And it is a privilege to be here today with
Canada's accomplished central bank governor, David Dodge. There are few people in central banks or
in governments around the world today that have presided over as far reaching and successful a set of
macroeconomic policy reforms as has David Dodge.
I want to offer some reflections about the challenges managing macroeconomic policy in a more open
and integrated world economy. And I want to say something about how the international monetary
system, and the current framework of exchange rate regimes, might develop in the coming years.
For the past century or more, choices about exchange rate regimes have played an important role in
economic outcomes across countries. From the Gold Standard of the late 19th and early 20th
centuries through the Bretton Woods system and the episodes of exchange rate cooperation among
the G5 and the G7 in the 1980s and after, the desire to achieve exchange rate stability was a major
preoccupation of policymakers. The economic damage inflicted by the disastrous competitive
devaluations among the major economies in the 1930s had a profound influence on thinking during
much of the postwar period. And for governments and enterprises around the world today, the
aversion to large fluctuations in exchange rates remains strong.
As the world has become more open to trade and more closely integrated, this sensitivity to exchange
rate variability has intensified. And yet, experience suggests that resisting variability makes the
adjustment to changing economic conditions more painful. In an increasingly open world economy, the
ability to cope with change becomes more important, and for a large fraction of the world economic,
exchange rate flexibility is a necessary condition for sustained favorable economic performance.
Changes in fundamental factors such as productivity growth and the inevitable shocks to demand and
supply require changes in relative prices, both domestically and internationally. A flexible exchange
rate regime makes it easier for relative prices to move rapidly and effectively in the appropriate
direction, and this generally eases the cost of that adjustment.
Even in a fixed rate regime, this adjustment in response to changing circumstances will ultimately have
to take place, of course. But if relative prices cannot adjust through the exchange rate, domestic
output and employment will have to bear the brunt of adjustment instead.
Since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, we have seen the emergence of a diverse range of
exchange rate arrangements. The large industrial economies have, by and large, decided to let their
currencies adjust to changing circumstances without official intervention in exchange markets. Japan
aside, it is now close to seven years since the last episode of concerted intervention among the major
economies; and there has been no Japanese intervention for two years.
Among emerging economies, too, we have seen a marked trend toward more flexible exchange rate
regimes. This is particularly pronounced in parts of Latin America. At the other end of the spectrum,
some of the newer members of the European Union are gearing up to adopt the euro. Somewhere in
the middle between these extremes of flexible exchange rate regimes and full monetary integration are
the emerging market economies, mostly in Asia and among the major oil exporters in the Gulf, that still
sustain fixed or partially fixed exchange rate regimes. Most of these countries link their currencies to
the dollar, though we see varying degrees of flexibility in the closeness of that link.
How has the world fared under this diverse mixed of flexible and fixed exchange rate regimes? In
general, I think, the costs of living with exchange rate volatility have been less than feared and
attempts to limit volatility have been more damaging and less effective than expected.
Take the experience of the major economies. Despite periods of very substantial swings in exchange
rates, and the amplitude of the changes in exchange rates among the major currencies since 1973
have been exceptionally large, economic growth in the major economies have become more stable,
not less. Quarterly GDP volatility in the United States, for example, has fallen by more than half since
the mid 1980s. And average rates of inflation and the variability of inflation outcomes have of course

BIS Review 44/2007

1

declined substantially as well. This is not to say that these swings in exchange rates have not come
with pain and trauma, only that overall economic performance has fared better than many would have
expected three decades ago when contemplating life under flexible exchange rates.
Among emerging markets, experience with exchange rate flexibility has been more limited, and the
record has been more mixed. Chile probably has one of the longest record of successful performance
under a flexible regime, success due in large part of course to a strong record of prudent
macroeconomic policy management and strong institutions. But there are many more examples today
– Brazil and Mexico are two – of emerging economies with sustained periods of improved growth and
inflation outcomes under more flexible exchange rate regimes.
Emerging market economies face substantially greater challenges than the less open major
economies in adjusting to a more integrated world and to the greater exposure to real and financial
volatility that comes with integration. Large movements in capital flows can complicate the task of
achieving sustainable growth, low inflation and financial stability. This is obvious for those countries
experiencing sharp net outflows of capital, but the challenges are formidable even for those countries
experiencing sustained periods of large inflows. And even those countries with more flexible exchange
rates can see competitiveness eroded if their major trading partners resist exchange rate appreciation.
For most countries, though, these challenges would be exacerbated rather than eased by a policy
designed to try to sustain a fixed rate or to narrowly constrain variability in the exchange rate. Although
it may seem counterintuitive, small open economies, even more than larger less open economies,
need the flexibility that floating exchange rates bring.
Changes in exchange rate regimes were present at the scene of most of the major emerging market
financial crises of the last decade, and many have argued that the decisions to let the exchange rate
adjust was a major source of the trauma that followed. But that's not a fair reading of the evidence. In
general, the crises were the consequence of fundamental economic problems, often manifested in the
buildup of substantial balance sheet problems, with excessive borrowing in foreign currency by the
sovereign, the banking system, or both.
These balance sheet problems were one reason many governments chose to postpone currency
adjustment for as long as possible, and these delays ensured that the cost of adjustment, when it was
forced on these governments, was far higher than if action had been taken earlier. But this is not the
whole story since the fixed exchange rate regime itself had contributed to the initial currency mismatch
and associated balance sheet problems. By engineering artificial expectations of stability, the regime
had led market participants to disregard the possibility of exchange rate devaluations, leading to
mispricing of risk, insufficient hedging and ultimately to misallocation of financial and real resources.
Governments that found themselves in this position had very limited ability to mitigate the economic
damage that was to come, but the policy choices that accompanied the exchange rate change often
compounded the problem.
Japan's experience provides another example, though the context was different. There is a perception
in parts of Asia that the Japanese government's decision to let the yen appreciate in the late 1980s
was principally responsible for Japan's so-called “lost decade” of low growth. And, Japan, viewed
through this prism, is cited as an example of the perils of letting an exchange rate move up in
response to changing fundamentals. The reality is more complex. The problems of the Japanese
economy in the 1990s were largely due to the aftereffects of the collapse of the real estate and asset
price boom of the preceding decade, a boom fueled in part by efforts by the monetary authorities to
limit the appreciation of the yen.
The size of the negative shock to demand from the collapse of the bubble was very substantial, and
the capacity of the government and the central bank to mitigate the damage was constrained by the
weakness in the banking system. A more forceful macroeconomic policy response, however, might
have brought about a quicker recovery. In any case, the problem with the exchange rate choice was
not the decision to let the rate adjust, but the decision to resist it and the role that played in magnifying
the bubble, and thereby the subsequent damage from the fall.
Given where we are today, and what we know about the relative merits of flexible and fixed exchange
rate regimes, what is the likely evolution of the current monetary system going forward? A few
concluding observations.
First, I think it is unlikely that we will see a substantial move toward monetary integration involving the
major emerging market economies, in Asia or in the Western Hemisphere. As the economist Peter

2

BIS Review 44/2007

Kenen writes in his latest book, it is difficult today to envisage a substantial reduction in national
currencies though the emergence of large regional monetary unions where they do not already exist.
Within Europe, we may yet see a further enlargement of the euro area. There may be other
circumstances in which individual economies can derive benefit from a currency board system or from
dollarization or euroization. Countries trying to emerge from a period of high inflation may in the future,
as they have in the past, adopt a fixed exchange rate as a nominal external anchor for a disinflation
strategy. These seem likely to be exceptions, however, to a general move toward more flexible
exchange rate regimes.
Even as regional economic integration increases in Asia and other parts of the world, these economies
seem a long way from the point where economic, or political conditions, will make a compelling case
for monetary integration. In Europe, of course, the political case for monetary integration to a large
extent preceded the economic case. And the architects of the European Union integration worked
consciously to induce a level of economic integration in Europe that would induce conditions that more
closely met the economist's test for an optimal currency area.
For most of the emerging markets today, in contrast, the challenge is to establish the conditions that
will enable them to live more comfortably in a world where their exchange rates will adjust more freely
in response to changing fundamentals. As these economies become more open to capital flows, they
will necessarily find it more difficult to occupy the tenuous middle ground with an exchange rate regime
that is neither fully fixed nor flexible, but managed in a way that closely tracks the value of the dollar or
carefully constrains fluctuations against the dollar.
This does not mean that these countries can be indifferent to exchange rate movements or that the
exchange rate is irrelevant to the conduct of monetary policy. For many small open emerging
economies, price stability and exchange rate stability are obviously intertwined, and a monetary rule
that responds effectively to inflation pressure cannot afford to overlook the signals coming from the
foreign exchange market. But attempts to target a particular level for the exchange rate or the slope of
the change in the rate in response to different conditions will, as the capital account becomes more
open, inevitably, come with substantial risks to monetary and financial stability.
Managing the transition to a more open capital account and a more flexible exchange rate regime is
not a simple task. These transitions need to be handled with care and attention to the development of
a strong institutional framework for monetary policy and the financial system. The more successful
transitions came in contexts where the monetary authorities were independent of political constraint,
where balance sheet problems and currency mismatches in the government and the financial system
were not acute, where the prevailing legal framework provided reasonable protections for property
rights and the enforcement of contract, and where there was effective supervision of the banking
system. Where these conditions were weaker, the transitions from fixed exchange rate regimes were
more traumatic.
These conditions seem exacting, and the understandable need for caution often is invoked in defense
of protracted and very gradual transitions. A certain degree of caution is wise: there is a great deal of
risk in a poorly managed and premature shift toward flexibility. But there is risk in gradualism too.
Delay magnifies the costs of living with the distortions caused by a managed rate.
Once relaxed, exchange and capital controls are both difficult and costly to reintroduce, and even
relatively modest steps back from an open regime can be damaging to confidence and credibility,
without buying much in the way of lasting stability.
The policy responses to the challenges that come with economic and financial integration principally
involve choices for governments at the national level. International cooperation can in some
circumstances help provide a more supportive environment, but there are no feasible changes to the
architecture of the international financial system that offer the prospect of a durably stable external
economic and financial environment for nations, large or small. Fundamentally, the only realistic
choice for policymakers is to equip their economies with the flexibility to cope more successfully in this
increasingly integrated global economy. And this means preparing for a world of more rather than less
flexibility in exchange rate regimes.
Thank you.

Timothy F Geithner: Liquidity risk and the global economy
Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's 2007 Financial Markets Conference –
Credit Derivatives, Sea Island, Georgia, 15 May 2007.
*

*

*

Thank you for giving me the chance to join you today. Although this is a conference primarily about
credit derivatives, I am going to talk about some of the broader changes we are seeing in financial and
credit markets, and their implications for policy.
You are meeting during a period of remarkable change and exceptional conditions in financial
markets.
Financial markets over the past several years have been characterized by an unusual constellation of
low forward interest rates, ample liquidity, low risk premia and low expectations of future volatility. In
some markets, asset prices have risen substantially, and credit growth has expanded rapidly. In credit
markets more generally, spreads have declined to levels that reflect very low expectations of near
term losses and credit standards have weakened.
It would not be accurate to say this is a world without volatility, for we have had a series of episodes of
sharp declines in asset prices and increases in volatility. But these episodes have been contained and
short lived, with markets recovering relatively quickly and with little appreciable effect on global
economic activity.
These conditions are global in nature, though they take somewhat different forms in different markets.
The forces behind all this are complex and not well understood, and this complicates any judgment of
how enduring they will prove to be.
The main candidates in terms of fundamental explanations involve change in economic conditions and
in the structure of financial markets.
There has been a marked improvement in global economic performance, with strong growth, relatively
low inflation, and less volatility in both growth and inflation. This seems to have reduced concern about
future fundamental risk, in terms of the potential damage of future shocks and in the ability of
governments and central banks to both avoid the policy errors of the past and to competently manage
some daunting longer-term policy challenges.
The global trend toward independent central banks with clearer mandates for price stability has
contributed to this confidence, as has the improvement in national balance sheets in emerging
markets, with stronger fiscal positions, higher reserves, and less exposure to foreign-currency
denominated debt.
Changes in financial markets, including those that are the subject of your conference, have improved
the efficiency of financial intermediation and improved our confidence in the ability of markets to
absorb stress. In financial systems around the world, the capital positions of banks have improved and
capital markets are becoming deeper and playing a larger role in financial intermediation. Financial
innovation has improved the capacity to measure and manage risk. Risk is spread more broadly
across countries and institutions.
Technological change and the relaxation of controls have made it possible for capital to move more
freely across national borders. And the characteristic reluctance of savers to invest outside their home
market may be diminishing.
Alongside these longer terms trends, financial markets today also show the effects of other forces. The
extraordinary growth in earnings of energy and commodity exporters, the substantial rise in wealth that
has come with rapid growth in China, India, and other emerging markets, together with efforts by many
of those governments to stem the appreciation of their currencies, has led to a rise in capital flows,
official and private, into the United States and other major economies. These flows seem large enough
to have had a material effect on global interest rates and asset prices.
These changes in economic conditions reinforce each other. The long period of relative economic and
financial stability has reinforced expectations of future stability, reducing implied volatility and risk
premia, increasing comfort with higher leverage, and encouraging flows of capital into riskier assets.

BIS Review 49/2007

The low level of real interest rates that has prevailed in much of the world through this expansion has
contributed to relatively accommodative financial conditions. The high levels of reserve accumulation
by governments with heavily managed exchange rate regimes put downward pressure on forward
interest rates, potentially distorting asset prices. The increase in size of sovereign wealth funds, the
shift in assets to hedge fund and private equity managers, and the possible reduction in home bias
among private savers have increased the amount of mobile capital in search of higher returns. The
resilience of the market in the face of the latest shocks has increased confidence in future financial
resilience. In these conditions, market participants face more acutely the classic dilemma of deciding
whether to follow the market, or to buy more insurance against the risk of a reversal at the expense of
near term returns.
This mix of forces operating on financial conditions presents challenges for policymakers and financial
markets participants, for it makes it harder to figure out what is fundamental and enduring and what is
temporary or transitional, or the result of policy distortions. Confidence exists alongside concerns
about sustainability.
Although there is much that is positive in the world today, there is little reason to believe we have
entered a new era of permanent stability. Financial innovation and global financial integration do not
offer the prospect of eliminating the risk of asset price and credit cycles, of manias and panics, or of
shocks that could have systemic consequences.
Over the past 25 years or so, we have seen a significant number of episodes of financial shocks, in
U.S. markets and globally. Although more different than similar in their nature and impact, they had
some common features. They were unanticipated. The causes varied, with some associated with a
substantial deterioration in the real economy, and others not. And they typically involved the dynamic
in which a sharp change in risk perception results in a fall in asset prices and a sharp reduction in
market liquidity, and an increase in correlations across asset classes. As market participants move to
protect themselves against further losses, by selling positions, requiring more margin, hedging against
further declines, the shock is amplified and the brake becomes the accelerator.
All markets are vulnerable to this dynamic. The degree of vulnerability is not something we can
measure with any confidence, for it depends not just on the how market participants behave in the
event, but on the complex interaction of a number of different factors. The vulnerability depends, for
example, on the size of the asset price misalignment, the conditions that produced it, and the
magnitude of the shock to confidence in economic fundamentals. It depends on the scale of leverage
in the system, and the incidence of leverage or concentration of exposure to different risk factors. It
depends on the diversity of exposures or positions of different financial institutions. It depends on the
presence or absence of distortions or market failures, moral hazard being the typical problem. It
depends on perceptions of the capacity for monetary policy and other policies to adjust to mitigate the
damage.
The dramatic changes we’ve seen in the structure of financial markets over the past decade and more
seem likely to have reduced this vulnerability. The larger global financial institutions are generally
stronger in terms of capital relative to risk. Technology and innovation in financial instruments have
made it easier for institutions to manage risk. Risk is less concentrated in the banking system, where
moral hazard concerns and other classic market failures are more likely to be an issue, and spread
more broadly across a greater diversity of institutions.
And yet this overall judgment, that both financial efficiency and stability have improved, requires some
qualification. Writing a decade ago about the history of the financial shocks of the 1980s and early
1990s, Jerry Corrigan wrote that these same changes in financial markets we see today, though less
pronounced then than now, created the possibility that financial shocks would be less frequent, but in
some contexts they could be more damaging. This judgment, that systemic financial crises are less
probable, but, in the event they occur could be harder to manage, should be the principal
preoccupation of market participants and policymakers today.
What factors might contribute to this risk, a risk that could be described as the possibility of longer,
fatter tails? One reason is a consequence of consolidation. The major banks are larger and stronger
today, and it would take a much larger shock to make them vulnerable than was true in the past. But in
that event, the consequence of their failure could be greater for markets.
Another reason is the consequence of leverage. Leveraged arbitrage activity, so some of the literature
suggests, is likely to reduce volatility in normal times and increase it in times of stress, because of the
greater financial constraints faced by leveraged funds relative to larger, more diversified banks and

2

BIS Review 49/2007

investment banks. Whether this matters in a systemic sense or not depends on the heterogeneity of
funds and how correlated their exposures are with those of the major banks and investment banks.
A third reason is the consequence of long periods of low losses and low volatility. When markets have
been through a sustained period of relative stability and low credit losses, this reduces the estimates
of potential losses produced by conventional risk management tools. Like gravity, this force is hard to
counteract. And when we’ve had a long period of low realized losses, rapid change in markets,
dramatic growth in new instruments, and larger potential leverage, this creates a greater possibility of
unanticipated losses, and therefore a greater potential for the trend amplifying, positive feedback
effects that have characterized the major asset price shocks of 1987 and 1998.
Policymakers do not have the capacity to eliminate the risk of excess leverage or asset price
misalignments, nor do we have the ability to act preemptively to diffuse them. And yet policy can play
a very important role in limiting the vulnerability of financial markets to the risk that a shock will pose
greater potential risks to the stability of the financial system and to economic growth. A few points
about both monetary policy and supervision in this context.
It is now the consensus of most practicing central bankers that monetary policy can’t do much
preemptively to correct an existing substantial asset price misalignment. But if monetary policy is
calibrated appropriately to keep aggregate demand growing roughly in balance with aggregate supply
and to keep inflation low and stable, this reduces the risk that such misalignments will emerge and
expand.
This is not always easy. It is especially hard to do in circumstances where the central bank is subject
to other policy objectives. The most prominent source of conflict is an exchange rate objective;
countries with even modestly open capital accounts will not find it possible to sustain a commitment to
prevent the exchange rate from appreciating without eventually facing the risk of rising credit growth,
asset price inflation, and inflation in the price of goods and services. This challenge is becoming
harder to manage for some large emerging market economies, and it is the principal reason why in
those countries there is an expectation in the markets that monetary policy will have to be tighter and
exchange rate regimes more flexible over time. And as this happens it will, among other things, alter
the balance of forces that have been operating on global capital flows.
Beyond monetary policy, the principal tools available to policymakers are the province of supervision.
And in this area, the most important things we can to reduce the risk of systemic financial crisis are to
strengthen the shock absorbers in the financial system, both in terms of the financial cushions
available to absorb losses and the capacity of the financial infrastructure to manage stress.
In terms of the financial cushions, the challenge is to sustain a level of capital and liquidity that is large
enough to withstand a more adverse financial and economic environment than we have experience
recently. Here the job of the risk management discipline is to try to compensate for failure of
imagination, to counteract the gravitational effect on measured exposure produced by recent history,
and to try to anticipate the adverse effects on market liquidity that may come with a shock. This
requires a healthy skepticism about models, discipline and care in the face of competitive pressures,
and humility about what we can know about the future.
In the world of infrastructure, the challenge is not just about the strength of the physical infrastructure,
the capacity to handle volume, operational resilience, and vulnerability to single points of failure. Here
the challenge is about the softer infrastructure, as well, such as the arrangements for resolving a credit
event or the close out or liquidation of a complex fund or institution.
The Federal Reserve is involved in a range of important initiatives on both fronts, working closely with
the lead supervisors of the major global financial institutions and market infrastructure operators. Over
the past few years, we have initiated targeted reviews, aimed at improving the sophistication of stress
testing practice, counterparty credit risk management in OTC derivatives, structured credit, and hedge
funds, and the post trade processing infrastructure in the OTC derivatives markets. We are also
looking carefully at liquidity risk management practice and the management of the bridge exposures
institutions run in leverage lending, leveraged buyout and merger and acquisition financing, and credit
activities more generally.
These initiatives are designed with several important features: first, to bring more evenness to the
incentives faced by the major global institutions, through closer cooperation across supervisors within
the United States and across countries; second, to foster more agility in the supervisory agenda, and a
capacity to adapt to change that more closely matches the rapid evolution in market developments;
and third, to try to encourage market-led initiatives, reinforced rather than imposed by supervision. The

BIS Review 49/2007

3

careful work of Counterparty Credit Risk Management Policy Group II led by Jerry Corrigan – with the
supervisory initiatives I referred to is an example. Today, 18 global banks outlined another set of
commitments to reduce settlement risk in the equity derivatives market.
This approach to supervision is designed to look ahead to try to ensure the adequacy of capital and
liquidity, and the sophistication of risk management discipline relative to risk, over time and at all
points in the cycle. I outlined earlier the reasons why monetary policy has only limited capacity to deal
preemptively with financial bubbles. Similarly, I see little prospect that supervision will have the
capacity to identify and address potential concentrations in exposure to individual risk factors, whether
through changes to capital charges or other means. Focusing on the quality and strength of cushions
against tail risk is the best way for supervision to be countercyclical rather than procyclical.
The subtitle of your conference is, I believe, “Where’s the Risk?” And as this implies, there is still
substantial interest in markets and official circles in finding ways to use greater transparency to
improve the capacity of markets, and supervisors, to try to address emerging risks early, to let the air
out of crowded trades and concentrations of leverage or risk before they reach potentially troubling
proportions. We will continue to explore ways to improve the quality of public disclosure by financial
institutions, and other sources of information on financial activity. But we do not have the capacity to
put in place a transparency regime over markets that would give people a real-time picture of the
incidence and magnitude of potential risks. The pace of change is too rapid, the number of positions,
funds, and institutions too great, and the analytical challenge too complex to offer the promise of that
type of early warning system.
The conditions we see prevailing in global financial markets today reflect a range of different factors,
some fundamental and others that are less likely to be enduring. The most effective thing that
policymakers and market participants can do in what is a necessarily uncertain world is to work to
ensure that the shock absorbers are strong relative to the range of potential economic and financial
outcomes.
Thank you.

Timothy F Geithner: Asia, the world economy and the international financial
system
Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, at the Economic Society of Singapore 2007 Annual Dinner, Singapore,
13 June 2007.

*

Good evening. I am pleased to be able to join you tonight. The past decade has been one of
remarkable achievement in Asia. This is a testament to the resilience and dynamism of this region,
and yet the memories of the financial crises remain vivid and still exert a powerful influence on policy
today. Tonight, I want to reflect on what policymakers learned from the crises, to review the extent of
the progress since and to examine some of the challenges ahead.
The Asian financial crises of the late 1990s were exceptional in many respects. Described at the time
by some as the first crises of the 21st century, they were commonly regarded as without precedent
and fundamentally different from previous emerging market financial crises. Here were countries with
a remarkable record of rapid economic growth over several decades, substantial rates of investment,
with low inflation and relatively strong fiscal positions. Most conventional indicators of economic
performance and financial strength did not suggest acute underlying vulnerability.
Yet the crises erupted with remarkable speed and force. The sudden collapse of confidence led to a
sharp reversal of capital flows to the region. On the eve of the crises, net capital inflows to the Asian
crisis countries were equal to almost 6 percent of their GDP. Over the next two years, the flow of
capital more than fully reversed. Income and output contracted abruptly: in the worst affected
countries, GDP shrank by more than 10 percentage points from peak to trough and in one case, the
contraction was closer to 15 percent. By any standards, these financial crises were unusually severe.
The crises marked a sudden and dramatic break with the past, and brought a new sense of
vulnerability to economies perceived as strong and successful.
Yet though some of the characteristics of the Asian crises distinguished them from other episodes of
financial turmoil, they shared several important features in common with crises in countries with
modern, market-oriented financial systems. They were largely unanticipated. A rise in borrowing
created vulnerability to a shift in asset prices. Uncertainty about the scale and nature of the underlying
vulnerability magnified the problem. Contagion spread rapidly. Markets overshot.
The fundamental economic and financial weaknesses that were the source of vulnerability were the
consequence of the interaction between weak domestic financial systems, selective liberalization of
controls on capital flows and fixed exchange rate regimes.
Banking systems combined relatively weak supervision with broad government guarantees, some
explicit, but more commonly implicit, reflecting a tradition of public sector intervention to protect
troubled companies and banks from failure. Tax and regulatory incentives promoted short-term
borrowing in foreign currency through the banking system. Capital inflows, largely through the banking
system, helped finance a boom in investment and real estate. Distortions in the financial system led to
a misallocation of resources so that high rates of private investment did not generate substantial
improvements in productivity. Exchange rate regimes where the domestic currency was fixed to the
dollar generated false expectations of stability, and the resulting increase in unhedged borrowing
generated large exposures to changes in the exchange rate or interest rates.
By 1997, the short-term external debt of the private sector had risen substantially, relative to GDP and
to reserves, and this created conditions similar to a classic bank run, when the crises hit.
The initial spark for the loss of confidence is still not fully clear, as is often the case in financial crises.
And although the particular dynamics differed across the countries in the region, the basic pattern was
common, with a rapid and sustained effort by domestic and foreign investors to reduce their exposure
to further losses. The initial effects of this behavior made the exchange rate commitments untenable,
and when those commitments were broken and currencies fell, the panic became self-reinforcing.
Uncertainty and lack of information fed the run. Market participants were unable to judge whether
deteriorating developments reflected temporary liquidity problems or deeper solvency issues. They

reacted by assuming the worst. These shifts in market sentiment risked becoming self-validating, with
liquidity problems transformed into solvency problems with broader risk of default.
The capacity of policymakers to restore stability was constrained by the depth of the balance sheet
problems. In some cases, where the scale of external borrowing was less acute, policymakers had
more room to act. But in most cases, policy options were very limited. Initially, governments were
reluctant to let exchange rates move too far, because of fears that this would force banks and
companies that had borrowed in dollars or yen into default on a scale that could further damage
growth. At the same time, the authorities were reluctant to tighten monetary policy as a way to help
stabilize the exchange rate because of concern it would hurt growth and perhaps exacerbate the flight
from domestic assets.
This dilemma made the initial policy response in the crisis countries look halting and tentative. And,
uncertainty about the strength and continuity of political leadership further hampered government
efforts to recover credibility. In the countries hit hardest by the crisis, looming issues of succession and
elections compounded the problem of confidence.
The crises prompted a searching reassessment of the conventional economic wisdom and a new
appreciation of the challenges that come with financial integration. The classic measures of
macroeconomic stability and policy prudence, in fiscal positions and measured inflation rates, could
mask substantial structural weaknesses, and these same structural weaknesses could ultimately
undermine the achievements of otherwise reasonably conservative macroeconomic policy
management. Partial capital account liberalization, which encouraged the accumulation of short-term
debt obligations, brought substantial risk, magnifying weaknesses in domestic financial systems.
Exchange rate commitments provided less stability than had been assumed. The rise in capital
mobility increased exposure to shifts in sentiment. Markets could now adjust much faster than policy
could typically react.
These judgments precipitated major changes in policies and a sustained investment in improvements
to the institutional framework of domestic financial systems across the region. And these changes in
turn laid the foundation for recovery and for the very substantial improvements in economic and
financial strength now evident across the region.

Achievements since the crises
Although it took some time for policy to begin to restore confidence, recovery was stronger and more
rapid than had been typical in other emerging market financial crises. Barely 18 months after the crisis,
for example, Korean GDP had returned to pre-crisis levels, and this was true for all the Asian crisis
countries by 2003. Growth has been relatively strong and stable since, though at a pace somewhat
below the unsustainable rates of the decade prior to the crises.
The balance sheets of the region have been transformed from weakness into strength. Current
account balances are generally in surplus. External debt of the banking and corporate sector has
fallen. Banking systems are now much less exposed to liabilities in foreign currencies; and the
currency mismatches that made economies so vulnerable as the crises erupted have been greatly
reduced. Official reserves have risen to levels without precedent in modern financial history.
Fiscal positions have strengthened. After rising initially with the substantial costs associated with bank
recapitalization programs, in recent years public debt ratios have generally been declining as a share
of GDP.
Monetary policy regimes have become more mature, with some progress toward greater de facto
independence for central banks, with clearer mandates for price stability.
Exchange rate regimes in the crisis countries have become somewhat more flexible, providing greater
scope for monetary policy to sustain the domestic conditions for price stability.
Financial systems are substantially stronger. Bank capital ratios now provide a significantly larger
cushion against potential losses – though capital ratios in Asian banking sectors are still generally
lower than those in other emerging economies. The quality of bank assets has improved. Nonperforming loans, estimated to have peaked at between one-quarter and three-quarters of total loans
in the crisis countries, are now under 10 percent of total loans. Financial institutions that required
government intervention have largely been restored to private ownership. Domestic capital markets

BIS Review 65/2007

are an increasingly important channel of intermediation in financial systems that had historically been
dominated by banks.
These are impressive achievements by any measure. And the changes that have taken place provide
a strong foundation for future growth and they make it much less likely that these economies will be
vulnerable to the type of crises of a decade ago. This progress is reflected in a broad range of financial
market indicators of risk. Risk premia in domestic interest rates markets are low. Spreads on
remaining dollar-denominated debt have fallen to levels that reflect little concern about future financial
stress.
It is important to bear in mind that some of the most dramatic changes in the performance of Asian
and other emerging market economies have taken place in an unusually benign economic
environment. The past four years have marked the strongest sustained period of growth for several
decades. Global interest rates have been relatively low. Asset prices in many markets have been
rising for a sustained period of time. Volatility in equity, interest rate and foreign exchange markets has
fallen to unusually low levels, and although we’ve seen the occasional sharp correction in some
markets, recovery has typically been quick.
These favorable conditions make everything look somewhat better than it otherwise would. But the
improvements in Asia are real, and they will make the region more resilient in the face of future
challenges.

The challenges ahead
Even with the relative prosperity of the recent past, policy in much of the region reflects substantial
ambivalence about the risks that come with financial openness. The memory of the trauma of the crisis
explains much of this ambivalence. The difficulties in managing this more recent period of substantial
capital inflows provides an additional source of unease. Policy regimes across the region are to a
significant degree directed at providing some insulation for the domestic economy from what is
considered a volatile global financial environment.
This impulse reflects itself in many different ways. It is manifested in exchange rate regimes that still
permit relatively limited variability against the dollar. It is manifested in the extent of reserve
accumulation, in part the consequence of resistance to exchange rate appreciation. And it is
manifested in the remaining controls on capital movements and the occasional experimentation with
the introduction of new controls.
The search for durable insurance against future volatility is an understandable response to the searing
experience of the crises of a decade ago. But there is risk in this as well. And the incomplete embrace
of integration could contain the seeds of future vulnerability.
In this sense, the policy agenda needs to move from a focus on creating stronger defenses against
crisis to building a greater ability to adapt to change. This requires strong institutions for the
management of macroeconomic policy so that the monetary and fiscal policies are able to respond to
shocks in a credible manner. It requires strong financial institutions with a substantial capacity to
absorb losses and cope with volatility. It requires regulatory policies that encourage competition and
innovation, with strong protections for property rights, low barriers to entry and effective financial
supervision. And it requires investments in a nation’s human capital, in education, healthcare and
pension provision. This complement of policies improves the prospects for producing the mix of
flexibility and resilience necessary for sustained growth in a more integrated world economy.
In emerging Asia, two key areas where there is the need and opportunity for further progress are in the
financial system and in the monetary policy framework.
The financial sector plays an important role in the flexibility and adaptability of economies to change, in
the resilience of economies and in the capacity of the monetary authorities to respond to adverse
shocks to asset prices or demand. Although much has been achieved in Asia over the past decade, as
the damage inflicted by the crises has been repaired, further reform will be important to the capacity of
these economies to innovate and grow and to live more comfortably with openness to capital flows.
This requires stronger banks and more developed capital markets. Thus far, we have seen more
progress on the former than the latter, but both are important and there remains considerable scope
for broadening and deepening capital markets in emerging Asia. The extent of financial innovation in
the industrial economies makes it possible for Asian countries to take advantage of huge

BIS Review 65/2007

3

improvements in the efficiency of financial intermediation. Embrace of these reforms will help ensure
that high levels of domestic savings are deployed more efficiently, that companies and financial
institutions are able to manage risks more effectively and that the financial system is more resilient in
the face of future stress.
Monetary policy regimes in much of Asia are burdened by two different types of constraints on
independence. The first relates to the institutional relationship between the central bank and the
government and the second to the multiple objectives assigned to the central banks.
All the evidence points to improved long-term inflation performance when monetary policymakers are
freed from institutional constraints that hamper their freedom of maneuver and given full operational
independence. Such independence is best achieved by enshrining it in an institutional framework that
provides for legal independence from the government, with accountability for achieving a clearly
defined mandate focused on price stability. Few Asian central banks yet enjoy full legal independence,
though most now have greater de facto independence than they once had.
Fixed, or partially fixed exchange rate regimes, of course, also constrain the independence of
monetary policy. As capital accounts become progressively more open, few countries can sustain over
time a commitment to exchange rate stability without risking price stability. Eventually central banks
will run up against limits on their capacity to sterilize the effects of exchange market intervention
designed to limit the pace and extent of appreciation of the exchange rate. Although measured
inflation in emerging Asian economies remains relatively low, the pace of credit growth and the
behavior of asset prices provide some evidence of a growing tension among competing objectives.
The longer this policy conflict persists, the greater the distortions building up in the economy, the
greater the risk of future inflation and the greater the risk of a bumpy future.
Reserves in emerging Asia recently passed the $2.5 trillion mark, double their size at the end of 2003.
Given the levels that have been reached in many countries, it may no longer be appropriate to view
rising reserves as a source of increasing strength against future volatility. They are, increasingly, signs
of the allocative distortions that result from the exchange rate regime. And they are in a sense too
much of a good thing.

Conclusion
The economic and financial transformation of the crisis economies has been extraordinary. The policy
reforms adopted in the wake of the crises have made those economies less vulnerable and more
resilient. And these changes justify substantial confidence about Asia’s economic future.
Asia’s success fundamentally changes the international economic and financial system. It is no longer
tenable to view the world as divided between a dominant core of mature industrial economies and a
smaller periphery of emerging economies. Asia is now so closely integrated with the rest of the world,
so large in relative terms, and growing so rapidly that the policy choices made in this region will have a
much greater impact on the rest of the world. And it means that Asia will need to prepare for a future in
which it relies more on the strength of growth at home rather than on the strength of growth in the rest
of the world.
As Asia makes further progress in financial reform and toward more flexible exchange rate regimes, it
will be in a better position both to deal with the inevitable challenges that come with economic and
financial integration, and to make the necessary transition to stronger domestic demand led-growth,
which will prove a more sustainable foundation for future improvements in living standards.
Thank you.

Timothy F Geithner: Reflections on the Asian financial crises
Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, at the Trends in Asian Financial Sectors Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco, San Francisco, 20 June 2007.
*

*

*

It is a pleasure to be here at the San Francisco Fed and to join you in looking back at the Asian
financial crises. Many people in this room played critical roles in the drama of that time. We did not
always completely agree, but we usually found a way to work together on a common strategy.
The crises hit with remarkable speed and force, with substantial effects on the world economy as a
whole. The collapse in confidence led to substantial and sustained outflows of capital, forcing large
exchange rate devaluations, a sharp fall in asset prices and leaving entire banking systems virtually
insolvent. GDP fell by between 10 and 15 percent. The crises forced substantial changes in the IMF’s
instruments for crisis resolution and a major international effort to strengthen financial systems.
Even after a decade, the crises are a subject of debate and controversy. For many, they represented a
failure of financial globalization, a dramatic demonstration of the perils of openness to capital flows. A
popular perception was that economies with strong records of growth and financial management were
forced into positions of vulnerability by externally imposed programs of capital-account liberalization
and then were pushed into turmoil by an unstable, even predatory international financial system.
Adherents of this view tended to view the policy response to the crisis as harsh or inept or both.
Time has taken some of the edge off these criticisms, but they still affect the political debate in the
region today. They reflect anxieties about the balance of risks and benefits of economic and financial
integration that still play an important role in shaping economic policy, even with the substantial
progress achieved since the crises.
I want to outline some of the principal lessons of that period, both in terms of reducing vulnerability to
financial crisis and in terms of strategies for crisis resolution. I offer these with the knowledge that it is
hard for anyone who was not a finance minister or a central bank governor in the region at the time to
understand what it was like. As one of those involved in shaping the international response, I can say
that there was a lot we did not fully appreciate about the dynamics of the crises then, and that justifies
humility today in thinking about the lessons for the future.
With those qualifications, here are a few thoughts on four important issues:
•

the role of balance sheet problems in creating vulnerability to crisis,

•

the challenge in designing an appropriate exchange rate regime and monetary policy
framework for emerging market economies,

•

the conditions for dealing with progressively greater openness to capital flows, and

•

the role of policy reforms and financial assistance in crisis resolution.

Currency mismatches and balance sheet problems
In general, the crises were the consequence of fundamental economic problems, often manifested in
the buildup of substantial balance sheet problems, with excessive short-term borrowing in foreign
currency by the sovereign, the banking system, or both.
In Asia, the accumulation of short-term debt was concentrated in the banking system. Banks borrowed
dollars and yen on a large scale and then lent those funds to corporations that earned their revenues
in domestic currency. This created a mismatch between the currency denomisnation of the banks’
liabilities and their assets. And this mismatch created an acute vulnerability to exchange rate risk.
The rapid increase in foreign currency exposure was encouraged by fixed exchange rate regimes,
since these created the illusion of protection from exchange rate risk. It was encouraged by tax
incentives that favored short-term foreign currency borrowing through offshore banking centers. It was
fed by the selective liberalization of capital controls on foreign borrowing, while limitations on equity
inflows were left in place. It was exacerbated by classic moral hazard – the result of past government

BIS Review 69/2007

1

interventions to limit corporate and bank failures. And it was made worse by poor disclosure, which
masked the scale of the increase in external liabilities and the deterioration in the level of official
reserves.
The scale of the buildup of foreign currency debt was fundamental to the dynamics of the crises. Once
confidence weakened, and fixed exchange rate commitments became unsustainable, the economies
experienced a sharp reversal in capital flows as both residents and nonresidents sought to limit their
exposure to domestic institutions and assets.
This broad flight from domestic assets created conditions similar to a classic bank run. The exchange
rate decline magnified concern about potential losses in the corporate sector and banking system,
which led to a further shift in assets out of the country, which exacerbated the exchange rate decline.
These balance sheet vulnerabilities led to a vicious cycle in which the exchange rate and financial
weaknesses reinforced each other.
As economies slipped toward the edge of the cliff, policymakers were left with alarmingly few options
to try to contain the crisis and mitigate the damage inflicted on the real economy. Given that real
interest rates were already negative, relaxing monetary policy further risked accentuating the
exchange rate decline, which would, in turn, have exacerbated the problems of the banking system.
But with demand already in free fall, policymakers were equally reluctant to tighten policy and risk
further damage to growth.
Fiscal positions in Asia were far weaker than they initially appeared to be because of the enormous
contingent liabilities that governments faced as a result of the collapse of the banking systems. This
limited the room for countercyclical fiscal policy, although each government moved eventually to put in
place modest fiscal stimulus.
This diagnosis of financial vulnerabilities led to a very substantial improvement in the quality of
national balance sheets in the region. More on this later.

Exchange rate regimes and the perils of the middle
A second, and closely related lesson, relates to the exchange rate regime. In the crisis countries, the
exchange rate regime of choice had been a fixed but adjustable peg. This was softer than a currency
board – the possibility of adjustment was built into the arrangement, but it was presented as a
commitment to a fixed nominal exchange rate for an indefinite period of time.
Although these regimes of limited exchange rate flexibility had been regarded as a means of achieving
economic stability, in fact they turned out to be a source of instability. Nominal exchange rates against
the dollar had been held fixed for some time, while real effective exchange rates had appreciated
significantly. Because of weaknesses in the financial system, the investment booms of the previous
decade had not translated into increased productivity.
As investors grew concerned about potential weakness, pressure on the exchange rate further
intensified until it became unsustainable. Exchange rate intervention proved ineffective. Once
confidence had been shattered, the markets responded with brutal speed and force. Monetary
authorities without a record of institutional independence and without a sufficiently clear mandate for
price stability did not have the experience or credibility needed to restore confidence quickly.
The crises helped bring about a fundamental reassessment of the merits of fixed but adjustable
exchange rate regimes, regimes that try to exist somewhere in the middle between the opposite
extremes of irrevocably fixed and purely floating. The new consensus, which you can now see in
policy choices across emerging markets, is that the soft middle is fundamentally untenable for an
economy that is open to cross-border capital flows. With the limited exceptions of those cases where
full monetary union or a currency board is optimal, or where a fixed exchange rate can provide a
nominal anchor for a disinflation strategy, the general view now is that flexible exchange rate regimes
make more sense for emerging market economies.
Exchange rate flexibility offers the advantage of allowing monetary policy to be directed at sustaining
price stability, which in turn offers a better prospect of sustained growth. Changes in fundamental
factors such as productivity growth and inevitable shocks to demand and supply require changes in
relative prices, both domestically and internationally. A flexible exchange rate makes it easier for
relative prices to move rapidly and effectively in the appropriate direction and so generally eases the
cost of adjustment.

2

BIS Review 69/2007

Regional economic integration has increased rapidly in Asia in recent years, but these economies still
seem a long way from the point where economic or political conditions would make a compelling case
for some kind of regional monetary integration. (In Europe, of course, the political case for monetary
integration largely preceded the economic argument.) For Asian economies, as for most emerging
economies today, the principal challenge is to establish conditions that will enable them to prosper in a
world where their exchange rates adjust more freely to changing fundamentals.

Capital-account liberalization
A third important conclusion from the crises relates to strategies for capital-account liberalization.
Although this was not the conventional wisdom at the time, I think the evidence supports the view that
the policy mistakes that contributed to the crises lay not in the decision to become more open to
capital flows, but in the how those governments chose to become more open.
The supervisory and regulatory regimes over the financial system did not provide a strong enough
framework of incentives for risk management and controls over financial intermediaries. But the more
consequential mistake was that the crisis economies each in different ways chose to liberalize capital
controls selectively. Each had in place other incentives or distortions that led to an excessive reliance
on short-term borrowing through the banking system.
These weaknesses left the financial system and the economies as a whole with less capacity to
manage the greater pressures and risks that came with openness to capital flows.
The policy consensus that has emerged from this experience has a more cautious view of the benefits
of financial integration, a greater awareness of the damage caused by creating incentives that distort
the composition of flows and a greater appreciation of the importance of having in place a strong set of
institutions, in the financial system in particular. It has also fostered a greater skepticism within
governments of their ability to sustain and adjust a set of limited controls on capital flows, once an
economy has passed a certain point of relative openness. Money tends to move around these controls
with progressive ease, and it becomes more difficult over time to counteract this force with acceptable
costs to other objectives. For this basic reason, many emerging market governments that were early
proponents of selective controls have moved to eliminate them.
Faced with the challenges of managing policy in an increasingly integrated world economy, the
dominant instinct of officials is often to try to shield the economy from volatility. But the crises of the
1990s helped demonstrate why this approach can be both futile and counterproductive. As economies
become more open to capital flows, policies designed to insulate an economy from external shocks,
whether they be fixed exchange rate regimes or selective capital controls and restrictions on
international transactions, rarely offer durable stability, and they bring additional risks. These risks
come in the form of additional distortions that might undermine future growth or magnify vulnerability to
future financial volatility.
The more promising approach is to invest in the complement of institutions and policies that enable an
economy to live more comfortably with openness. Focusing on those measures that will enable an
economy to be more flexible and to adapt more quickly to change ultimately will be a more effective
policy strategy. It is politically more difficult, but economically more effective than those solutions that
seem to offer protection from competition and volatility.

Crisis resolution
A fourth lesson, or series of lessons, comes from our experience in crisis resolution. The strategies
adopted to stabilize markets and then to foster recovery varied significantly across the crisis
economies. Each involved a somewhat different mix of policy reforms and temporary financial
assistance, tailored to the different conditions that prevailed.
Where there was success, the common feature was what Larry Summers called the Powell Doctrine
applied to international finance – the overwhelming use of force, with a clear strategy for resolution.
The “force” in this sense applied both to the scale of financing made available relative to the need and
to the quality of the policy measures.
Very substantial resources were deployed in support of the recovery efforts, and a large share of the
resources was made available upfront, in order to try to mitigate the liquidity problem and to stem the
loss of confidence. In contrast to the typical IMF program, governments were permitted to use a

BIS Review 69/2007

3

portion of the IMF-supplied resources to take some pressure off the exchange rate, as foreign
investors sought to reduce their exposures to the crisis countries in the initial stages of the crises.
But the provision of large external financial resources was not, by itself, sufficient to achieve stability.
The critical feature of every program was a set of policy measures designed to address the causes of
the crisis, to stabilize confidence and to put in place conditions for recovery.
In some cases, the initial policy response looked tentative or inadequate. In others, the reform
program did not appear to have broad support within the government. Broader political uncertainty
associated with a pending election or change in leadership also undermined confidence in the
commitment to a credible recovery plan. Where confidence in the recovery plan was weak, the
financial resources had little impact on market sentiment and confidence faltered. Even though the
resources looked large relative to past financial interventions, they were easily overwhelmed when
markets were unimpressed by the policy response.
Ernesto Zedillo explained the policy challenge exceptionally well when he wrote that since markets
tend to overreact at the onset of crisis, so policy needs to overreact too.
A classic problem in financial crises is to distinguish between problems of illiquidity and insolvency.
This diagnosis is critical to the design of an effective response, but it is very hard to do. We – in this
case I mean the IMF, its major creditors and the governments in the region – treated these cases as
closer to the illiquidity extreme on the continuum, rather than to the insolvency extreme.
In the Asian crisis countries, unlike in Russia or Argentina, there was no plausible case for arguing that
the sovereign governments had accumulated debts they were unable to repay. A forced restructuring
of the external debt of a country or a forced suspension of payments on those obligations would have
made the crisis in Asia, and more broadly, substantially worse.
These were not conditions of insolvency, but nor were they purely temporary liquidity problems that
could have been addressed through the quick infusion of unconditional finance without any change in
policies. The crisis economies all tried that strategy in the weeks and in some cases months before
going to the IMF for assistance. Those strategies failed not simply because the governments ran out of
reserves, but because they had failed to embrace a broader set of policy changes powerful enough to
restore confidence in future stability and growth.
It is worth emphasizing that the strategies ultimately adopted in each case were quite unorthodox and
were certainly not uniform. Besides the novel approach adopted in terms of the scale and structure of
financing and the degree of international cooperation in support of the programs, the policy packages
were also notable in the degree of emphasis placed on, for example, financial-sector reform and
improvements to disclosure.
In each case, the reforms proposed were the result of careful analysis of the causes of the individual
crises and a pragmatic assessment of what was needed to correct the conditions that had led to
problems and to restore confidence. And in all cases, the strategy was continually modified and
adjusted as conditions changed and as the principals responsible developed a better feel for what was
working and what was not.

Conclusion
Recovery in the Asian crisis countries took time, but it was stronger and more rapid than had been
typical in other emerging market financial crises. Barely 18 months after the crisis, for example,
Korean GDP had returned to pre-crisis levels, and this was true for all the Asian crisis countries by
2003. Growth has been relatively strong and stable since, though at a pace somewhat below the
unsustainable rates of the decade prior to the crises.
The countries directly affected by the crises a decade ago are fundamentally stronger. The balance
sheet weaknesses have been transformed into strength. Financial-sector reforms have been
undertaken on a generally impressive scale. Stronger legal and institutional frameworks have helped
create an environment in which enterprise is thriving. Macroeconomic policy has been reasonably
prudent, and debt-to-GDP ratios are declining. Exchange rate regimes have become more flexible.
These changes have made these economies far more resilient than they were a decade ago. They are
much less likely to face the type of crisis, the acute, self-reinforcing panic produced by the balance
sheet problems of that era.

Is there more to be done? Of course, but the challenge now is not so much the challenge of building
stronger defenses against crisis, but rather the longer-term challenge of building a greater capacity to
adapt to change in this increasingly integrated and rapidly evolving global economy.

Timothy F Geithner: The economic dynamics of global integration
Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, at the Forum on Global Leadership: US Competitiveness in a
Globally Integrated Economy, Washington DC, 25 July 2007.
*

*

*

We are meeting at a time of relatively favorable U.S. economic performance, but also of
growing concern about our relative position in the world and our longer-term economic
prospects at home.
On a wide range of measures, the American economy and American business are
performing well. We are in the fifth year of expansion in the United States and in the midst of
the strongest global economic expansion in more than three decades. Corporate profits as a
share of GDP are close to the highest level in four decades.
Corporate balance sheets are healthy. The six-month trailing bond default rate has stayed
near zero this year, and the delinquency rate on commercial and industrial loans at banks
remains extremely low.
We have seen a substantial acceleration in trend productivity growth over the past decade.
And although productivity gains have slowed recently, as they typically do as expansions
mature, U.S. companies remain at the forefront of changes in science and technology—and
in the application of those innovations to business processes across a range of industries.
Overall, the U.S. economy continues to display remarkable resilience and flexibility, despite a
range of adverse shocks. This is a remarkably favorable picture; and yet there is growing
concern about the long-term challenges for the U.S. economy and their implications for future
prosperity.
In parts of the business community, there is growing anxiety about a perceived shift in the
locus of dynamism and growth away from the United States toward Asia and other parts of
the world.
Public opinion surveys report increased concern among Americans about economic security;
about the prospects for future income growth and economic mobility; and about the
implications of the long-term increase in income inequality.
And there we can see growing concern among the general public and in the business
community about the struggle to find a political consensus to support reforms to help us meet
these challenges.
The United States has long been one of the most open of the major economies. This basic
policy choice, along with a range of other actions that have made our economy relatively
flexible, has allowed us to be a substantial beneficiary of the rapid increase in global
economic integration and in the growing economic success of the rest of the world.
Globalization has brought challenges as well as benefits, however. The combined forces of
technological change, immigration, and the rapid integration of China, India, and other
economies into the world economy are altering the dynamics of competitive pressures on
U.S. companies. The pace of change seems to be increasing, and more things we produce,
and more of our services, are becoming tradable. And this seems to have fed anxiety, among
firms and their employees, about the challenges in coping with these forces.
These changes have taken place in the context of a longer-term increase in income
inequality in the United States. Incomes have grown more rapidly for the richer and better
educated than for those at lower points of the income scale.

BIS Review 84/2007

These changes have, in turn, contributed to some erosion in the strength of the political
center in the United States on a range of economic policy issues. Surveys suggest
diminished support for global trade. And there is more divisiveness on a range of issues such
as tax policy and the appropriate role for government in the regulation of economic activity.
Over the last half century and more, the U.S. economy has enjoyed some substantial and
important relative advantages. Among the most important of these are the quality of our best
universities; our openness to change; the incentives provided for innovation; the strength of
property rights; the depth and liquidity of our world-class financial markets; and a record of
stability in macroeconomic policy.
These relative strengths of the U.S. economy remain significant and substantial. But the rest
of the world is getting better at establishing the important conditions for dynamism and
innovation. These improvements are not a reflection of U.S. weakness, nor are they
themselves a threat to U.S. competitiveness. We will benefit from more rapid growth in the
rest of the world, but at the same time we need to be more attentive to addressing a range of
challenges that could ultimately damage the prospect for future growth in living standards
here at home.
I want to talk about challenges we face in four areas:
•

sustaining support for global economic integration,

•

the role of public policy in education and other areas that are critical to our capacity
to adapt to change,

•

regulation and the role of the market, and

•

macroeconomic policy.

Let me start with openness.
The pressures that have come with globalization and technological change have led many to
suggest that we should become less open as a country, that we should slow the pace of
integration, or that we should provide greater insulation or protection from competition for
selective parts of the U.S. economy.
Moving in this direction would, I believe, be a fundamental mistake. More than ever before
our fortunes are linked to those of the global economy. If anything, we need to become more
open, not less; more open to trade in goods and services, but also to investment, to people
and to ideas.
Global integration is not the solution to all our problems, but acting to restrict it or to insulate
us from its consequences would damage our capacity to grow and to adapt to change, and
these costs would make it harder, not easier, to deal with our longer-term challenges. To the
extent we are reluctant to remove restrictions or subsidies in the United States, we make it
easier for the forces in other countries to block reforms from which we would benefit.
The world has a lot of experience with the costs and benefits of protection, and the balance
of judgment on those questions has not significantly changed even with all the changes that
technology and policy have brought to global trade. Economies that are more open have
generally seen more rapid growth, both in incomes and in employment. Economies that are
less open have generally grown less rapidly.
Openness itself, of course, is not enough.
Our capacity to adapt to change depends in part on the effectiveness of government policy in
a range of important areas. Education seems the most obvious of these, but policy in health
care, in public infrastructure, and many other areas will also play an increasingly important
role in determining the relative strength of the U.S. economy in this more integrated world.
The U.S. educational system combines the strengths of high completion rates for secondary
education, a rich variety of post-secondary school educational options, and exceptionally

2

BIS Review 84/2007

strong elite universities, with the weaknesses of substantial unevenness in the quality of
public education, and large disparities in the educational opportunities available to those of
modest income and the relatively rich. By some estimates, students from families in the
bottom half of the income distribution account for only 10 percent of all places in our elite
universities.
An education system should be judged by how it serves the majority of the population, not
just the performance of its best institutions. And as technological progress continues and
global integration increases, our system will be judged by how good a job it does equipping a
broader range of students with the skills commensurate with these challenges. In
communities across the country, there are encouraging efforts at experimentation and
reform. Progress is probably going to require more substantial public investments in
education going forward.
Health care does not usually make the agenda of conferences on competitiveness, but we’re
seeing a welcome wave of attention in the business community to the broader economic
imperative of health care reform. The U.S. system has compelling strengths in the quality of
care and the choices available to much of the population. But our system is also remarkable
for the magnitude of the costs, the incidence of those costs across the economy, the number
of uninsured, and our poor performance on health outcomes even compared with less
wealthy economies. To cite just one example, infant mortality rates in the United States are
more than two times the level in Japan.
In a world in which economic performance depends increasingly on flexibility and adaptability
to change, we probably need to move to a system in which a change in employer or
profession does not carry the substantial uncertainty it does today about how one will provide
for one’s health and that of one’s family. This seems fundamental to the willingness of
Americans to support the level of openness to trade and to change that is an essential part of
our present and our future.
A defining feature of the American economy has been our embrace of the market, and the
recognition that market forces are, in general, the most effective way of allocating resources.
But markets cannot solve all problems, and government policy plays an important role in how
well markets function. The test of policy is not just in the incentives we create for competition
and innovation, but also in the clarity and stability offered by the regulatory framework and in
the quality of public goods that governments deliver.
Any one who travels outside the United States today returns with an appreciation about how
rapidly public infrastructure is improving in many parts of the world, relative to what is evident
in many parts of the United States.
As global markets become more integrated and companies and capital can move more freely
across borders, policymakers will face new challenges in the design of regulations. They will
have to look more carefully at the balance of benefits and costs, when companies have more
choice about where to invest. They will have to find ways for regulations to evolve more
quickly in response to developments in markets. They will have to explore ways to cooperate
more closely with other governments, where national approaches alone cannot be effective.
We need to get used to a world in which we will see, in many areas, less willingness to adopt
a U.S. model or to defer to a U.S. view on the appropriate global standard.
You can see some of these dynamics in the financial arena, and concern about the erosion
in the relative position of the U.S. financial system.
Financial markets outside the United States are now deeper and more liquid than they used
to be, making it easier for companies to raise capital domestically at reasonable cost. These
financial markets are at an earlier stage in the process of capital market development, and
they will therefore experience rapid growth in securitization and the role of derivatives.

These factors, more than other differences in tax, accounting, or legal regulatory regimes,
account for the bulk of the declines' share of equity and debt raised in the United States by
companies around the world. And this shift is something that we benefit from, not just in the
direct sense that U.S. financial institutions play an important role in those markets, but in the
broader sense that we will gain from the improvements in economic growth that come from
financial market development around the world.
But in this context, we need to be more attentive to the risk that specific aspects of our
system, regulations or other constraints, create a greater disincentive to locate a financial
business here, or to invest here, or to raise capital here, than would have been the case five
or ten years ago. We need to take a careful look at how we regulate financial activity in a
world where capital is more mobile, and the structure of the financial system has diverged
substantially from the system for which our regulatory framework was designed.
That does not mean we should contemplate weaker regulation or lower standards. The
strength of the U.S. system is in part the result of the confidence we have developed in the
integrity and resilience of our markets, in part by establishing strong standards for investor
protection, market practices, and safety and soundness. Sustaining this confidence will be
critical to the future strength of our financial system.
To complete this list of policy challenges that are important to U.S. competitiveness, let me
conclude with a few brief points on the broader imperatives of macroeconomic policy.
The United States faces very substantial gaps between our fiscal resources and our
expenditure commitments. The size of these gaps, these deficits, have been masked in
recent years by a substantial, unanticipated and probably transitory surge in revenues, and
by an unusually long period of unusually low long-term interest rates, in part the
consequence of foreign official capital flows.
But these gaps remain substantial and the U.S. fiscal position is unsustainable. Time does
not help. We are going to have to begin to develop a political consensus on the mix of policy
changes that can bring our commitment and resources more into balance, if we are to
preserve confidence in our market and our long-term economic prospects.
One of the most important roles for public policy is the maintenance of a stable
macroeconomic framework that enables firms to make long-term investment decisions. In
this sense, the fiscal policy choices ahead for this country will be critically important to the
overall environment in which U.S. enterprises operate.
The business community will play an important role in shaping the policy response to these
longer-term economic challenges. These reforms will have a long fuse. The benefits will be
shared broadly, rather than captured specifically by particular sectors of the economy.
American companies have a strong collective interest in sustaining public support for global
integration, improving the quality of public goods the government provides in education,
health care and infrastructure, and in preserving confidence in U.S. fiscal sustainability.
Thank you.

Timothy F Geithner: Restoring market liquidity in a financial crisis
Welcoming remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Second New York Fed-Princeton University
Liquidity Conference, New York, 13 December 2007.
*

Welcome to the New York Fed and to this conference on liquidity. You are addressing some
of the most important issues affecting financial markets today. Your timing is good, perhaps
too good. We are all going to need some time and perspective before we will know enough to
draw conclusions and recommendations from the events of the past six months. The
conditions that led to this crisis took a long time to develop and they will take some time to
resolve. I think it is appropriate, though, that as central banks act to address the challenges
in markets today, we also begin to define the agenda for future research and policy.
On December 12, the Federal Reserve and several other major central banks, announced a
series of actions in response to the elevated pressures in funding markets. Together, these
actions provide a more flexible and potentially more effective set of instruments, alongside
our conventional monetary policy instruments, to help mitigate the risks that liquidity
pressures in markets going forward could pose to the broader economy. With this framework
of tools, we have the capacity to calibrate our response as market conditions change.
Although the specifics vary across central banks, the approaches outlined have several
important common elements. We each have taken actions to provide more financing at terms
longer than overnight. We each have chosen to auction funding against a broader range of
collateral, collateral other than government securities, and in our case with a broader set of
counterparties. And we have activated swap lines to help the relevant central banks provide
liquidity in dollars in their markets.
The initial spark to the pressures we observe in markets today was the sharp deterioration in
the value of nonprime mortgage securities and the resulting increase in uncertainty about the
value of a much larger amount of financial assets exposed to that risk. This was magnified by
a substantial increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook and the consequences of
that uncertainty for asset values and credit losses. Financial institutions faced a sharp drop in
demand for a range of assets, impairing the securitization market as a source of funding. And
a substantial amount of these illiquid assets were held in vehicles with implicit or explicit
liquidity guarantees provided by banks. This produced a large unexpected increase in
demand for funding from banks at the same time banks confronted a reduced capacity to
raise financing.
As market participants have adjusted to what has been a very acute change in expectations
about economic and credit risk, they have become more cautious in how they use their
liquidity and capital. The symptoms of this are apparent in the high risk premia across a
range of assets, as well as in the dramatic contraction in the volume of transactions for
certain assets and the securities that reference those assets. Elevated term premia in the
interbank market has the effect of tightening overall financial conditions, offsetting some of
the impact of reductions in the target federal funds rate.
The danger this poses is the risk of an adverse, self-reinforcing dynamic in which concerns
about overall liquidity magnify concerns about credit problems. As financial institutions
prepare for a more challenging funding environment, in part by conserving capital, and as
they anticipate the higher potential losses that would normally accompany an economic
slowdown, their response, in aggregate, makes markets and the economy potentially more
vulnerable to that adverse outcome. The risk is a greater contraction in the availability of
credit beyond what might have otherwise occurred, with attendant risks to growth.

Monetary policy has an important role to play in addressing these dynamics in markets. By
adjusting policy proactively as the risk to the outlook changes, central banks can help reduce
the probability of the extreme adverse outcome. And this can positively affect the incentives
that might otherwise lead market participants to protect themselves against the extreme
outcome.
Central banks have been employing a range of different tools to help reduce the incentive for
an excessive level of liquidity hoarding by banks that might impede an efficient flow of
liquidity among banks. Although the mix of tools and approaches has varied across the major
economies, each has tried to provide a more effective form of liquidity insurance to its
financial institutions by expanding the capacity of banks to borrow at longer maturities from
the central banks against a broader range of collateral.
The actions to address liquidity issues – those we announced this week and those that we
have taken over the past five months – can help reinforce our monetary policy actions by
providing greater assurance for market participants of access to funding. By allowing strong
banks to borrow against collateral that they can no longer easily finance in the market, the
central bank is providing an additional source of liquidity to banks as a complement to our
open market operations.
The Term Auction Facility gives us a tool that lies somewhere between our open market
operations and our primary credit program. It provides a mechanism for expanding the range
of collateral against which we provide funds to the market – in effect to change the
composition of our balance sheet – in ways we cannot do through traditional open market
operations. And it does this in a way that may be more effective in mitigating a broader
marketwide liquidity shortage than does the existing discount window facility, in part because
of the perceived stigma in recourse to a facility that has come to be regarded as a source of
funds for individual institutions facing a temporary, exceptional need for liquidity. Because the
quantity of funds to be injected is known in advance, this mechanism poses fewer
complications for our ability to reduce volatility in the fed funds rate around the target.
The auction facility and other measures we have taken to address market liquidity problems
do not directly address the balance sheet or capital constraints facing financial institutions.
Nor can they be expected directly to reduce the perceived risk in exposure to other financial
counterparties. But by providing a more effective form of access to liquidity, these new
measures can help reduce the uncertainty that gives institutions the incentive to secure
liquidity in ways that might lead to a further deterioration on market conditions.
Major financial institutions in the United States and elsewhere entered this period of
adjustment with capital substantially above the various regulatory thresholds. These capital
cushions have enabled banks to expand their balance sheets as they have met contingent
commitments and as the economics of other non-bank financing vehicles have deteriorated.
This has been an important part of the adjustment process in markets.
We have also seen some early steps by a range of different institutions to bring new capital
into the banking and financial system. This is a healthy development. It reduces the need for
further asset sales to preserve capital ratios. And it gives those institutions that acted earlier
and on a more substantial scale the flexibility to play a greater role in markets and in the
economy going forward.
Finally, let me say something about future challenges in this area that are of special
relevance to today’s conference and to the research agenda in which you are all engaged.
We are already involved in a coordinated review with other central banks and supervisors of
how we should adapt policy and supervision in the wake of this financial crisis. Two issues
are of particular interest in the context of this conference.
The first relates to the incentives we create, through regulation and supervision and other
policies, for influencing how financial market participants manage liquidity risk. Several
aspects of the existing capital framework and other parts of the policy and regulatory

2

BIS Review 149/2007

framework affect these incentives. In addition, the evolution of the financial system has
altered the role and importance of liquidity provision by banks and how that provision of
liquidity responds to different types of stress to the financial system.
The second issue relates to the tools that central banks have at their disposal for providing
liquidity in ways that do support our monetary policy objectives. Do we need additional
instruments that would better enable us to mitigate marketwide liquidity problems? And how
can we mitigate the moral hazard risk inherent in such instruments?
Efforts are underway to address these issues both within the Fed and among our central
banking colleagues around the world. We will be looking both to financial market participants
and to the academic community for advice.
For now, though, our principal task is to address the challenges of the present. The Federal
Reserve Act gives us broad authority to act in response to these types of conditions. We will
continue to examine ways to adapt our instruments as market conditions evolve. We will do
so in close cooperation with other central banks, as indeed we have since August. And we
will do so in the tradition of pragmatism and flexibility that has been one of the defining
features of the central bank of the United States.
Thank you.

Timothy F Geithner: The current financial challenges – policy and
regulatory implications
Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, at the Council on Foreign Relations Corporate Conference 2008,
New York, 6 March 2008.

I am going to talk today about some of the challenges facing the U.S. and financial system.
These problems took a long time to build up, and, even with a forceful mix of public policy
and action by the private sector, they will take time to resolve.
The central questions are: what caused the crisis and what explains its severity? What mix of
policy measures will best contain the damage? And what changes to the financial system are
likely to produce greater stability and resilience in the future?
Origins
The origins of this crisis lie in complex interaction of number of forces. Some were the
product of market forces. Some were the product of market failures. Some were the result of
incentives created by policy and regulation. Some of these were evident at the time, others
are apparent only with the benefit of hindsight. Together they produced a substantial financial
boom on a global scale.
In the five years leading up to the present stress, the world experienced an unusual mix of
financial conditions.
Real short-term interest rates were reduced around the world, following a nearly decade long
secular decline in inflation rates, a slowdown in growth at the turn of this decade and
subsequent deflation. As central banks raised their policy rates when the outlook improved
and deflation risks had dissipated, both real and nominal long-term interest rates remained
anomalously low.
Global savings appeared to rise faster than did perceived real investment opportunities, and
this development helped to push down real long-term interest rates around the world. At the
same time, many emerging market economies built up very large levels of official reserves to
reduce external vulnerability and to hold the value of their currencies stable against the
dollar. The exchange rate policies in these economies – economies that together accounted
for a increasing share of global GDP – made overall global financial conditions more
accommodative, even as the United States and other countries tightened their monetary
policies.
Expected and realized volatility in both debt and equity markets were remarkably low for
most of the last half a decade. Term premiums declined and remained low over much of this
period. Credit spreads across a wide range of asset classes fell to levels that assumed
unusually low levels of future losses. In the United States, credit, and mortgage credit in
particular, expanded relative to GDP. Many households – including those previously lacking
access to credit or with access only to expensive credit – found they could borrow on a
significant scale to finance the purchase of a home and other expenses. Prices rose across a
range of real and financial assets, most notably the prices of homes.
This constellation of broad economic and financial conditions was accompanied by rapid
innovation in financial instruments that made credit risk easier to trade and, in principle at
least, to hedge. These instruments allowed investors to buy insurance or protection against a
broader range of individual credit risks, such as the default by a home owner or a company.
Issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS), collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and
