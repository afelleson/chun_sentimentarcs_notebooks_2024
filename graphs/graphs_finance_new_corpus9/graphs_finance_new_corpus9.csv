It is a pleasure to be here at the Council on Foreign Relations, and to be here with Jerry Corrigan.
A few brief remarks about the global economy, both the real and financial dimensions, to provide a basis for our discussion.
2006 marked the fourth successive year of a global expansion that has been remarkable for its strength, for its breadth, and for its stability in the face of economic shocks and uncertainty in the geopolitical realm.
This period of broad-based growth in income has been supported by a number of important fundamental forces.",1.0

This general constellation of market conditions and asset prices is unusual, at least in comparison to what we have seen over the past several decades.
This has been a distinguishing feature of the present expansion, but it is not something we fully understand, and we cannot be confident in judgments about how durable it will prove to be.
To a significant extent, these financial developments reflect a high degree of confidence in future macroeconomic and financial stability, reinforced by the improvements in inflation performance, growth outcomes and financial resilience of the past several years.
Better monetary policy has lowered expectations of future inflation and inflation volatility and has contributed to lower risk premiums in general.

intermediation and credit provision, coupled with the increased stability of the real economy, seem likely to have reinforced the improvements on the monetary policy front.
And rapid growth in the major emerging market economies, together with the substantial earnings of energy-producing and commodity-exporting countries, have produced a substantial increase in wealth and savings relative to perceived investment opportunities.
In a world where capital can now flow much more freely across national borders, a significant portion of these savings has moved across national borders.",2.0
1,39,peak,0.5972456331680978,"This has entailed a sustained period of very substantial official accumulation of dollar reserves, putting downward pressure on U.S. interest rates and upward pressure on U.S. asset prices.
These forces are surely transitory, but their impact on capital flows, interest rates and asset prices are important, not just in terms of their short-term impact on growth.
If they are large enough, they have the potential to alter or distort current decisions about investment and consumption in a way that could be detrimental to our longer-run growth prospects.
And they are important because they work to mask or dampen the effects on risk premiums in financial markets that we might otherwise expect to be associated with the expected trajectory of the fiscal and external imbalances in the United States.
Given this broad context, I want to touch briefly on some of the policy issues that are likely to be important to the prospects for economic performance, here and around the world.
Despite the relatively favorable performance of the global economy, we face a range of daunting longer-term economic policy challenges.
The improvements in the conduct of monetary policy were critical to the improvements in productivity and growth that we are now seeing on a global scale.
And monetary policy will, of course, continue to be critical, but monetary policy alone cannot provide the elements of the framework necessary to provide an environment for innovation and long-term decisions that will be so vital for future growth.
Economic policy, in general, needs to be more forward looking in providing a longer-term framework for stability.
On the fiscal policy front, demographic changes confront governments around the world with exceptionally difficult choices.",5.0

Timothy F Geithner: Liquidity and financial markets Keynote address by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the 8th Annual Risk Convention and Exhibition, Global Association of Risk Professionals, New York, 28 February 2007.
We have been in a period that market participants have characterized as one of exceptional liquidity.
This is both a reflection of, and has contributed to, the ongoing expansion in the world economy.
I want to focus my remarks today on the role of liquidity in markets, and what supervisors and market participants can do to make markets more robust against the shocks that we know will occur from time to time.
These remarks are directed to a general phenomenon related to developments in the financial markets in recent years, and not to the specific conditions of the moment.
Liquidity plays a central role in the functioning of financial markets.
Structural changes in the financial system that have been underway for some time increase the importance of market liquidity.
The allocation of capital increasingly relies on securities markets, where funds for investment in the real economy are raised through the direct issuance of securities to investors.",5.0
2,90,peak,0.39484173642179826,"Liquidity can mean many different things.
One dimension of liquidity is the availability of credit or the ease with which institutions can borrow or take on leverage.
This is generally referred to as funding liquidity.
Another dimension of liquidity is the ease with which market participants can transact, or the ability of markets to absorb large purchases or sales without much effect on prices.
This is what is generally called market liquidity.
Although these two concepts are distinct, they are closely related and are often mutually reinforcing.
Fundamentally this is so because when funding liquidity is abundant traders have the resources with which to finance trading positions that smooth price shocks and make markets liquid.
In practice, this mutually reinforcing behavior is driven by a complex array of factors, including the degree of leverage embedded in the markets at any given time, the difficulty that lenders face in discerning whether a surge in volatility is driven by a transitory shock of some kind or a permanent shock to fundamentals, and risk management practices.
Institutions manage the credit risk in their trading-related exposure by requiring some counterparties to post collateral or margin.
Typically, institutions require of hedge fund counterparties both initial margin against potential loss and variation margin, which requires payment to cover any decline in the value of the position.",9.0
2,136,valley,0.24941832380687845,"Some policy makers have argued that public disclosure of information could help reduce the risk of future systemic financial crisis, by preventing the buildup of ""excessive"" leverage or concentrations of risk.
The principal focus of attention, as in the immediate wake of the failure of Long Term Capital Management, has been on two quite different types of public disclosure.
The first is information that would make it easier to evaluate the overall leverage or risk profile of major hedge funds and their counterparties, and thereby judge their vulnerability to a sharp movement in asset prices.
The second is information about the actual positions of individual funds or institutions: information that would make it easier to identify concentrated exposures to specific risk factors, and thereby assess more accurately the potential impact of the failure of a major fund or institutions on the market as a whole.
These pose very different challenges and offer different benefits.
There are a number of crude measures of overall risk profile that, if disclosed to the market, would give counterparties information they do not now typically get about the risk of failure of the fund.
One example is data on the size of
BIS Review 19/2007
daily variations in net asset value, VAR, or profit and loss over the previous quarter.
This type of information would not reveal proprietary information about trading strategies or otherwise create substantial disincentives to risk taking.",10.0
3,162,peak,0.32835090713210496,"We continue to explore ways in which the provision of greater information to counterparties and to the markets more generally could help reduce vulnerability to financial crises.
For now, though, the practical limitations on achieving greater transparency underscore the importance strengthening the robustness of the shock absorbers in the financial system.
We are not likely to ever be in a position where we have the capacity to identify the source and estimate the probability of future financial shocks.
And policy makers are unlikely to ever be in a position to diffuse concentrations of risk or crowded trades ahead of a crisis.
The most sensible thing we can do is to improve the capacity of the core of the financial system to handle adversity, and this requires continued focus on improving the strength of the capital and liquidity cushions, as well as the market infrastructure.
Let me end with a few quick thoughts on the role of monetary policy in this context.
Can monetary policy play a pre-emptive role in reducing the vulnerability of financial markets to the type of dynamic we saw in 1987 and 1998?
Central banks cannot realistically hold out the prospect of using monetary policy to prevent asset price bubbles, conditions of ""excess"" leverage in parts of the financial system, or other factors in markets that might lead to the types of positive feedback dynamics that were at the heart of some past crises.
And yet many of the observations made about liquidity and market conditions over recent years have potential implications for monetary policy.
Changes in risk premia, the level of asset prices, credit spreads, and interest rates, and in realized and expected volatility of asset prices  these can all affect the pace at which overall demand grows, and can therefore potentially affect future inflation.",13.0
3,193,valley,0.21761345918481972,"For borrowers, credit market innovation offers the prospect of increased credit supply; better pricing; and a relaxation of financial constraints.
For investors, new credit instruments bring the prospect of broader risk and return opportunities; the ability to diversify portfolios; and increased flexibility.
And for lenders, innovations can help free up funding and capital for other uses; they can help improve credit risk and asset/liability management; and they can improve the return on capital and provide new and cheaper funding sources.
By spreading risk more broadly, providing opportunities to manage and hedge risk, and making it possible to trade and price credit risk, credit market innovation should help make markets both more efficient and more resilient.
They should help make markets better able to allocate capital to its highest return and better able to absorb stress.
Broad, deep and well-functioning capital markets complemented by strong, well-capitalized banks, able to provide liquidity in times of strain, make for a more efficient financial system: one which contributes to better economic growth outcomes over time.
There are therefore compelling arguments in favor of a generally positive assessment of the consequences of innovation.
Does experience provide support for these arguments, or are these changes too new for us to know?
The recent changes in credit markets have been dramatic.
We have seen rapid growth of structured credit products, credit default swaps and new types of collateralized debt and loan obligations.",11.0

The recent changes in credit markets have been dramatic.
We have seen rapid growth of structured credit products, credit default swaps and new types of collateralized debt and loan obligations.
Although these instruments are very new, they are the natural extension of earlier innovations in credit markets.
Over a long period we have seen innovations ranging from the syndication of bank loans and the direct provision of credit through the capital markets, to the spread of asset-backed securities and products that separate different parts of the payments stream and different dimensions of the risk in a credit obligation into different instruments.
These changes have contributed to a substantial reduction in the share of total credit held by banks.
They have produced a greater separation or distance between the entity that first arranges a loan and those who end up holding the risk, and more intermediaries in that chain.
And they have contributed to a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of creditors to any individual borrower, and a greater capacity to actively trade credit risk.
BIS Review 29/2007
We are now well into the third decade of experience with the consequences of these earlier innovations, and this history offers some useful lessons for evaluating the probable impact of the latest changes in credit markets.",14.0
4,221,valley,0.1404540090370186,"Although recent experience as well as theory provide some reassurance against the concern that credit market innovation would make markets more volatile and the financial system more vulnerable, these judgments require qualification.
Some aspects of this latest wave of innovation are different in substance  therefore potentially in their implications  from their predecessors.
And these differences require attention.
There are three aspects of the latest set of changes which I think deserve more reflection.
The first is about the role of market liquidity and liquidity risk in how credit markets work.
Credit market innovations have transformed the financial system from one in which most credit risk is in the form of loans, held to maturity on the balance sheets of banks, to a system in which most credit risk now takes an incredibly diverse array of different forms, much of it held by nonbank financial institutions that mark to market and can take on substantial leverage.
U.S. financial institutions now hold only around 15 percent of total credit outstanding by the nonfarm nonfinancial sector: that is less than half the level of two decades ago.
For the largest U.S. banks, credit exposures in over-the-counter derivatives is approaching the level of more traditional forms of credit exposure.
Hedge funds, according to one recent survey, account for 58 percent of the volume in credit derivatives in the year to the first quarter of 2006.
Financial shocks take many forms.",13.0
5,275,peak,0.33707811804779003,"We do not have the capacity to monitor or control concentrations of leverage or risk outside the banking system.
We cannot identify the likely sources of future stress to the system, and act preemptively to diffuse them.
The most productive focus of policy attention has to be on improving the shock absorbers in the core of the financial system, in terms of capital and liquidity relative to risk and the robustness of the infrastructure.
These issues are the principal focus of day-to-day supervision and market oversight in the major financial centers around the world.
The Federal Reserve is actively involved in a range of efforts, working closely with the primary supervisors of the major global financial institutions and the critical parts of the financial infrastructure, to encourage further progress.
In this context, we are working to put in place a stronger regulatory capital regime and to strengthen the capacity of firms to absorb losses in stress conditions.
We are encouraging more sophisticated and more conservative management of credit exposures in over-the-counter derivatives and structured financial products, as well as of exposures to hedge funds.
And we are encouraging a range of efforts to modernize the operational infrastructure that underpins the over-the-counter derivatives markets, and to improve the capacity of market participants to manage a major default.
The stronger these shock absorbers, the more resilient markets will be in the face of future shocks, and the more confident we can be that banks will be a source of strength and of liquidity to markets in periods of stress and that the financial system will contribute to improved economic performance over time.

5,290,valley,0.3178478157163834,"There are few people in central banks or in governments around the world today that have presided over as far reaching and successful a set of macroeconomic policy reforms as has David Dodge.
I want to offer some reflections about the challenges managing macroeconomic policy in a more open and integrated world economy.
And I want to say something about how the international monetary system, and the current framework of exchange rate regimes, might develop in the coming years.
For the past century or more, choices about exchange rate regimes have played an important role in economic outcomes across countries.
From the Gold Standard of the late 19th and early 20th centuries through the Bretton Woods system and the episodes of exchange rate cooperation among the G5 and the G7 in the 1980s and after, the desire to achieve exchange rate stability was a major preoccupation of policymakers.
The economic damage inflicted by the disastrous competitive devaluations among the major economies in the 1930s had a profound influence on thinking during much of the postwar period.
And for governments and enterprises around the world today, the aversion to large fluctuations in exchange rates remains strong.
As the world has become more open to trade and more closely integrated, this sensitivity to exchange rate variability has intensified.
And yet, experience suggests that resisting variability makes the adjustment to changing economic conditions more painful.
In an increasingly open world economy, the ability to cope with change becomes more important, and for a large fraction of the world economic, exchange rate flexibility is a necessary condition for sustained favorable economic performance.",8.0

declined substantially as well.
This is not to say that these swings in exchange rates have not come with pain and trauma, only that overall economic performance has fared better than many would have expected three decades ago when contemplating life under flexible exchange rates.
Among emerging markets, experience with exchange rate flexibility has been more limited, and the record has been more mixed.
Chile probably has one of the longest record of successful performance under a flexible regime, success due in large part of course to a strong record of prudent macroeconomic policy management and strong institutions.
But there are many more examples today  Brazil and Mexico are two  of emerging economies with sustained periods of improved growth and inflation outcomes under more flexible exchange rate regimes.
Emerging market economies face substantially greater challenges than the less open major economies in adjusting to a more integrated world and to the greater exposure to real and financial volatility that comes with integration.
Large movements in capital flows can complicate the task of achieving sustainable growth, low inflation and financial stability.
This is obvious for those countries experiencing sharp net outflows of capital, but the challenges are formidable even for those countries experiencing sustained periods of large inflows.
And even those countries with more flexible exchange rates can see competitiveness eroded if their major trading partners resist exchange rate appreciation.",7.0
6,344,valley,0.3552065353235867,"In any case, the problem with the exchange rate choice was not the decision to let the rate adjust, but the decision to resist it and the role that played in magnifying the bubble, and thereby the subsequent damage from the fall.
Given where we are today, and what we know about the relative merits of flexible and fixed exchange rate regimes, what is the likely evolution of the current monetary system going forward?
A few concluding observations.
First, I think it is unlikely that we will see a substantial move toward monetary integration involving the major emerging market economies, in Asia or in the Western Hemisphere.
As the economist Peter
BIS Review 44/2007
Kenen writes in his latest book, it is difficult today to envisage a substantial reduction in national currencies though the emergence of large regional monetary unions where they do not already exist.
Within Europe, we may yet see a further enlargement of the euro area.
There may be other circumstances in which individual economies can derive benefit from a currency board system or from dollarization or euroization.
Countries trying to emerge from a period of high inflation may in the future, as they have in the past, adopt a fixed exchange rate as a nominal external anchor for a disinflation strategy.",7.0

Countries trying to emerge from a period of high inflation may in the future, as they have in the past, adopt a fixed exchange rate as a nominal external anchor for a disinflation strategy.
These seem likely to be exceptions, however, to a general move toward more flexible exchange rate regimes.
Even as regional economic integration increases in Asia and other parts of the world, these economies seem a long way from the point where economic, or political conditions, will make a compelling case for monetary integration.
In Europe, of course, the political case for monetary integration to a large extent preceded the economic case.
And the architects of the European Union integration worked consciously to induce a level of economic integration in Europe that would induce conditions that more closely met the economist's test for an optimal currency area.
For most of the emerging markets today, in contrast, the challenge is to establish the conditions that will enable them to live more comfortably in a world where their exchange rates will adjust more freely in response to changing fundamentals.",11.0
7,367,valley,0.3082534201451118,"These conditions seem exacting, and the understandable need for caution often is invoked in defense of protracted and very gradual transitions.
A certain degree of caution is wise: there is a great deal of risk in a poorly managed and premature shift toward flexibility.
But there is risk in gradualism too.
Delay magnifies the costs of living with the distortions caused by a managed rate.
Once relaxed, exchange and capital controls are both difficult and costly to reintroduce, and even relatively modest steps back from an open regime can be damaging to confidence and credibility, without buying much in the way of lasting stability.
The policy responses to the challenges that come with economic and financial integration principally involve choices for governments at the national level.
International cooperation can in some circumstances help provide a more supportive environment, but there are no feasible changes to the architecture of the international financial system that offer the prospect of a durably stable external economic and financial environment for nations, large or small.
Fundamentally, the only realistic choice for policymakers is to equip their economies with the flexibility to cope more successfully in this increasingly integrated global economy.
And this means preparing for a world of more rather than less flexibility in exchange rate regimes.
Thank you.",9.0
8,391,peak,0.40223678582937406,"This seems to have reduced concern about future fundamental risk, in terms of the potential damage of future shocks and in the ability of governments and central banks to both avoid the policy errors of the past and to competently manage some daunting longer-term policy challenges.
The global trend toward independent central banks with clearer mandates for price stability has contributed to this confidence, as has the improvement in national balance sheets in emerging markets, with stronger fiscal positions, higher reserves, and less exposure to foreign-currency denominated debt.
Changes in financial markets, including those that are the subject of your conference, have improved the efficiency of financial intermediation and improved our confidence in the ability of markets to absorb stress.
In financial systems around the world, the capital positions of banks have improved and capital markets are becoming deeper and playing a larger role in financial intermediation.
Financial innovation has improved the capacity to measure and manage risk.
Risk is spread more broadly across countries and institutions.
Technological change and the relaxation of controls have made it possible for capital to move more freely across national borders.
And the characteristic reluctance of savers to invest outside their home market may be diminishing.
Alongside these longer terms trends, financial markets today also show the effects of other forces.
The extraordinary growth in earnings of energy and commodity exporters, the substantial rise in wealth that has come with rapid growth in China, India, and other emerging markets, together with efforts by many of those governments to stem the appreciation of their currencies, has led to a rise in capital flows, official and private, into the United States and other major economies.",8.0
8,406,valley,0.3732328107847103,"The high levels of reserve accumulation by governments with heavily managed exchange rate regimes put downward pressure on forward interest rates, potentially distorting asset prices.
The increase in size of sovereign wealth funds, the shift in assets to hedge fund and private equity managers, and the possible reduction in home bias among private savers have increased the amount of mobile capital in search of higher returns.
The resilience of the market in the face of the latest shocks has increased confidence in future financial resilience.
In these conditions, market participants face more acutely the classic dilemma of deciding whether to follow the market, or to buy more insurance against the risk of a reversal at the expense of near term returns.
This mix of forces operating on financial conditions presents challenges for policymakers and financial markets participants, for it makes it harder to figure out what is fundamental and enduring and what is temporary or transitional, or the result of policy distortions.
Confidence exists alongside concerns about sustainability.
Although there is much that is positive in the world today, there is little reason to believe we have entered a new era of permanent stability.
Financial innovation and global financial integration do not offer the prospect of eliminating the risk of asset price and credit cycles, of manias and panics, or of shocks that could have systemic consequences.
Over the past 25 years or so, we have seen a significant number of episodes of financial shocks, in U.S. markets and globally.

It depends on the diversity of exposures or positions of different financial institutions.
It depends on the presence or absence of distortions or market failures, moral hazard being the typical problem.
It depends on perceptions of the capacity for monetary policy and other policies to adjust to mitigate the damage.
The dramatic changes weve seen in the structure of financial markets over the past decade and more seem likely to have reduced this vulnerability.
The larger global financial institutions are generally stronger in terms of capital relative to risk.
Technology and innovation in financial instruments have made it easier for institutions to manage risk.
Risk is less concentrated in the banking system, where moral hazard concerns and other classic market failures are more likely to be an issue, and spread more broadly across a greater diversity of institutions.
And yet this overall judgment, that both financial efficiency and stability have improved, requires some qualification.
Writing a decade ago about the history of the financial shocks of the 1980s and early 1990s, Jerry Corrigan wrote that these same changes in financial markets we see today, though less pronounced then than now, created the possibility that financial shocks would be less frequent, but in some contexts they could be more damaging.",10.0

The past decade has been one of remarkable achievement in Asia.
This is a testament to the resilience and dynamism of this region, and yet the memories of the financial crises remain vivid and still exert a powerful influence on policy today.
Tonight, I want to reflect on what policymakers learned from the crises, to review the extent of the progress since and to examine some of the challenges ahead.
The Asian financial crises of the late 1990s were exceptional in many respects.
Described at the time by some as the first crises of the 21st century, they were commonly regarded as without precedent and fundamentally different from previous emerging market financial crises.
Here were countries with a remarkable record of rapid economic growth over several decades, substantial rates of investment, with low inflation and relatively strong fiscal positions.
Most conventional indicators of economic performance and financial strength did not suggest acute underlying vulnerability.
Yet the crises erupted with remarkable speed and force.
The sudden collapse of confidence led to a sharp reversal of capital flows to the region.",14.0
10,507,peak,0.19480121680560009,"The fundamental economic and financial weaknesses that were the source of vulnerability were the consequence of the interaction between weak domestic financial systems, selective liberalization of controls on capital flows and fixed exchange rate regimes.
Banking systems combined relatively weak supervision with broad government guarantees, some explicit, but more commonly implicit, reflecting a tradition of public sector intervention to protect troubled companies and banks from failure.
Tax and regulatory incentives promoted short-term borrowing in foreign currency through the banking system.
Capital inflows, largely through the banking system, helped finance a boom in investment and real estate.
Distortions in the financial system led to a misallocation of resources so that high rates of private investment did not generate substantial improvements in productivity.
Exchange rate regimes where the domestic currency was fixed to the dollar generated false expectations of stability, and the resulting increase in unhedged borrowing generated large exposures to changes in the exchange rate or interest rates.
By 1997, the short-term external debt of the private sector had risen substantially, relative to GDP and to reserves, and this created conditions similar to a classic bank run, when the crises hit.
The initial spark for the loss of confidence is still not fully clear, as is often the case in financial crises.
And although the particular dynamics differed across the countries in the region, the basic pattern was common, with a rapid and sustained effort by domestic and foreign investors to reduce their exposure to further losses.
The initial effects of this behavior made the exchange rate commitments untenable, and when those commitments were broken and currencies fell, the panic became self-reinforcing.",15.0
10,528,valley,0.17091750730215824,"This dilemma made the initial policy response in the crisis countries look halting and tentative.
And, uncertainty about the strength and continuity of political leadership further hampered government efforts to recover credibility.
In the countries hit hardest by the crisis, looming issues of succession and elections compounded the problem of confidence.
The crises prompted a searching reassessment of the conventional economic wisdom and a new appreciation of the challenges that come with financial integration.
The classic measures of macroeconomic stability and policy prudence, in fiscal positions and measured inflation rates, could mask substantial structural weaknesses, and these same structural weaknesses could ultimately undermine the achievements of otherwise reasonably conservative macroeconomic policy management.
Partial capital account liberalization, which encouraged the accumulation of short-term debt obligations, brought substantial risk, magnifying weaknesses in domestic financial systems.
Exchange rate commitments provided less stability than had been assumed.
The rise in capital mobility increased exposure to shifts in sentiment.
Markets could now adjust much faster than policy could typically react.
These judgments precipitated major changes in policies and a sustained investment in improvements to the institutional framework of domestic financial systems across the region.",12.0

And the incomplete embrace of integration could contain the seeds of future vulnerability.
In this sense, the policy agenda needs to move from a focus on creating stronger defenses against crisis to building a greater ability to adapt to change.
This requires strong institutions for the management of macroeconomic policy so that the monetary and fiscal policies are able to respond to shocks in a credible manner.
It requires strong financial institutions with a substantial capacity to absorb losses and cope with volatility.
It requires regulatory policies that encourage competition and innovation, with strong protections for property rights, low barriers to entry and effective financial supervision.
And it requires investments in a nations human capital, in education, healthcare and pension provision.
This complement of policies improves the prospects for producing the mix of flexibility and resilience necessary for sustained growth in a more integrated world economy.
In emerging Asia, two key areas where there is the need and opportunity for further progress are in the financial system and in the monetary policy framework.

As economies slipped toward the edge of the cliff, policymakers were left with alarmingly few options to try to contain the crisis and mitigate the damage inflicted on the real economy.
Given that real interest rates were already negative, relaxing monetary policy further risked accentuating the exchange rate decline, which would, in turn, have exacerbated the problems of the banking system.
But with demand already in free fall, policymakers were equally reluctant to tighten policy and risk further damage to growth.

Monetary authorities without a record of institutional independence and without a sufficiently clear mandate for price stability did not have the experience or credibility needed to restore confidence quickly.
The crises helped bring about a fundamental reassessment of the merits of fixed but adjustable exchange rate regimes, regimes that try to exist somewhere in the middle between the opposite extremes of irrevocably fixed and purely floating.
The new consensus, which you can now see in policy choices across emerging markets, is that the soft middle is fundamentally untenable for an economy that is open to cross-border capital flows.
With the limited exceptions of those cases where full monetary union or a currency board is optimal, or where a fixed exchange rate can provide a nominal anchor for a disinflation strategy, the general view now is that flexible exchange rate regimes make more sense for emerging market economies.
Exchange rate flexibility offers the advantage of allowing monetary policy to be directed at sustaining price stability, which in turn offers a better prospect of sustained growth.
Changes in fundamental factors such as productivity growth and inevitable shocks to demand and supply require changes in relative prices, both domestically and internationally.
A flexible exchange rate makes it easier for relative prices to move rapidly and effectively in the appropriate direction and so generally eases the cost of adjustment.

These relative strengths of the U.S. economy remain significant and substantial.
But the rest of the world is getting better at establishing the important conditions for dynamism and innovation.
These improvements are not a reflection of U.S. weakness, nor are they themselves a threat to U.S. competitiveness.
We will benefit from more rapid growth in the rest of the world, but at the same time we need to be more attentive to addressing a range of challenges that could ultimately damage the prospect for future growth in living standards here at home.
I want to talk about challenges we face in four areas:
sustaining support for global economic integration,
the role of public policy in education and other areas that are critical to our capacity to adapt to change,
regulation and the role of the market, and
macroeconomic policy.",2.0
13,827,valley,0.551981227909657,"And this shift is something that we benefit from, not just in the direct sense that U.S. financial institutions play an important role in those markets, but in the broader sense that we will gain from the improvements in economic growth that come from financial market development around the world.
But in this context, we need to be more attentive to the risk that specific aspects of our system, regulations or other constraints, create a greater disincentive to locate a financial business here, or to invest here, or to raise capital here, than would have been the case five or ten years ago.
We need to take a careful look at how we regulate financial activity in a world where capital is more mobile, and the structure of the financial system has diverged substantially from the system for which our regulatory framework was designed.
That does not mean we should contemplate weaker regulation or lower standards.
The strength of the U.S. system is in part the result of the confidence we have developed in the integrity and resilience of our markets, in part by establishing strong standards for investor protection, market practices, and safety and soundness.
Sustaining this confidence will be critical to the future strength of our financial system.
To complete this list of policy challenges that are important to U.S. competitiveness, let me conclude with a few brief points on the broader imperatives of macroeconomic policy.
The United States faces very substantial gaps between our fiscal resources and our expenditure commitments.
The size of these gaps, these deficits, have been masked in recent years by a substantial, unanticipated and probably transitory surge in revenues, and by an unusually long period of unusually low long-term interest rates, in part the consequence of foreign official capital flows.
But these gaps remain substantial and the U.S. fiscal position is unsustainable.",4.0
14,867,peak,0.6178100364596009,"The symptoms of this are apparent in the high risk premia across a range of assets, as well as in the dramatic contraction in the volume of transactions for certain assets and the securities that reference those assets.
Elevated term premia in the interbank market has the effect of tightening overall financial conditions, offsetting some of the impact of reductions in the target federal funds rate.
The danger this poses is the risk of an adverse, self-reinforcing dynamic in which concerns about overall liquidity magnify concerns about credit problems.
As financial institutions prepare for a more challenging funding environment, in part by conserving capital, and as they anticipate the higher potential losses that would normally accompany an economic slowdown, their response, in aggregate, makes markets and the economy potentially more vulnerable to that adverse outcome.
The risk is a greater contraction in the availability of credit beyond what might have otherwise occurred, with attendant risks to growth.

Monetary policy has an important role to play in addressing these dynamics in markets.
By adjusting policy proactively as the risk to the outlook changes, central banks can help reduce the probability of the extreme adverse outcome.
And this can positively affect the incentives that might otherwise lead market participants to protect themselves against the extreme outcome.
Central banks have been employing a range of different tools to help reduce the incentive for an excessive level of liquidity hoarding by banks that might impede an efficient flow of liquidity among banks.",4.0

Two issues are of particular interest in the context of this conference.
The first relates to the incentives we create, through regulation and supervision and other policies, for influencing how financial market participants manage liquidity risk.
Several aspects of the existing capital framework and other parts of the policy and regulatory
BIS Review 149/2007
framework affect these incentives.
In addition, the evolution of the financial system has altered the role and importance of liquidity provision by banks and how that provision of liquidity responds to different types of stress to the financial system.
The second issue relates to the tools that central banks have at their disposal for providing liquidity in ways that do support our monetary policy objectives.
Do we need additional instruments that would better enable us to mitigate marketwide liquidity problems?
And how can we mitigate the moral hazard risk inherent in such instruments?",3.0
15,920,peak,0.6443618261611422,"Origins The origins of this crisis lie in complex interaction of number of forces.
Some were the product of market forces.
Some were the product of market failures.
Some were the result of incentives created by policy and regulation.
Some of these were evident at the time, others are apparent only with the benefit of hindsight.
Together they produced a substantial financial boom on a global scale.
In the five years leading up to the present stress, the world experienced an unusual mix of financial conditions.
Real short-term interest rates were reduced around the world, following a nearly decade long secular decline in inflation rates, a slowdown in growth at the turn of this decade and subsequent deflation.
As central banks raised their policy rates when the outlook improved and deflation risks had dissipated, both real and nominal long-term interest rates remained anomalously low.
Global savings appeared to rise faster than did perceived real investment opportunities, and this development helped to push down real long-term interest rates around the world.",3.0

Many households  including those previously lacking access to credit or with access only to expensive credit  found they could borrow on a significant scale to finance the purchase of a home and other expenses.
Prices rose across a range of real and financial assets, most notably the prices of homes.
This constellation of broad economic and financial conditions was accompanied by rapid innovation in financial instruments that made credit risk easier to trade and, in principle at least, to hedge.
These instruments allowed investors to buy insurance or protection against a broader range of individual credit risks, such as the default by a home owner or a company.
