Why would it?
You was just a child, but youre a little older now.
A lot older in some ways.
Listen to me, Danny.
The world has a way of keeping things in balance.
I believe that.
Theres a saying: When the pupil is ready, the teacher will appear.
I was your teacher.
You were a lot more than that, Danny said."

His True name is Crow Daddy.
Do you love him?
You do, dont you?
Rose smiled, drew Andi closer, kissed her.
But she did not answer.
Am I . . . am I still human?
To this Rose gave the same answer Dick Hallorann had once given young Danny Torrance, and in the same cold tone of voice: Do you care?
Andi decided she didnt.
She decided she was home."

No one was.
Everyone was sleeping, talking with their seatmates, or staring out at the gray New England day.
You dont have to live this way if you dont want to.
If only that were true.
Nevertheless, he tightened the cap on the bottle and put it on the seat beside him.
Twice he picked it up.
The first time he put it down.
The second time he reached into the bag and unscrewed the cap again, but as he did, the bus pulled into the New Hampshire welcome area just across the state line.
Dan filed into the Burger King with the rest of the passengers, pausing only long enough to toss the paper bag into one of the trash containers."

The snow was still falling, but gently now.
I should get out of here.
Go back to Florida.
Fuck New Hampshire, where it probably even snows on the Fourth of July in odd-numbered years.
Halloranns voice answered him, the tone as kind as he remembered from his childhood, when Dan had been Danny, but there was hard steel underneath.
You better stay somewhere, honey, or you wont be able to stay anywhere.
Fuck you, oldtimer, he muttered.
He went back to the Red Apple because the stores that sold hard liquor wouldnt be open for at least another hour.
He walked slowly back and forth between the wine cooler and the beer cooler, debating, and finally decided if he was going to get drunk, he might as well do it as nastily as possible."

And yeah, I guess there are Milne characters on the walls in that one.
But if Id taken off my watch, Id remem .
He trailed off.
You do remember, Dan said, and smiled.
Now you do.

Azzie was a twelve-pounder.
Other than during his afternoon naps, Az rarely stayed in one location for long; he always had places to go, people to see, things to do.
(That cats a playa, Claudette had once told Danny.)
You might see him visiting the spa, licking a paw and taking a little heat.
Relaxing on a stopped treadmill in the Health Suite.
Sitting atop an abandoned gurney and staring into thin air at those things only cats can see.
Sometimes he stalked the back lawn with his ears flattened against his skull, the very picture of feline predation, but if he caught birds and chipmunks, he took them into one of the neighboring yards or across to the town common and dismembered them there.
The rec room was open round-the-clock, but Azzie rarely visited there once the TV was off and the residents were gone.
When evening gave way to night and the pulse of Rivington House slowed, Azzie became restless, patrolling the corridors like a sentry on the edge of enemy territory."

With any luck, the Salkowiczes told each other as they ate their gift dessert for breakfast, theyd come back next year.
Do you know what?
Maureen said.
I dreamed that lady on the insurance commercialsFlosold you a big insurance policy.
Wasnt that a crazy dream?
Ernie grunted and splooshed more whipped cream onto his bread pudding.
Did you dream, honey?

You said wed talk later.
This is later.
What happened back there?
We had a looker, Rose said.
Really?
Crow raised his eyebrows.
He had taken as much of the Trevor kids steam as any of them, but he looked no younger.
He rarely did after eating.
On the other hand, he rarely looked older between meals, unless the gap was very long."

Tucked up and ready to go tomorrow morning at seven a.m.
John, I feel like drinking.
Oh, nooo!
John cried in a trembling falsetto.
Not booooze!
And just like that the urge was gone.
Dan laughed.
Okay, I needed that.
But if you ever do the Michael Jackson voice again, I will drink."

Lennie OMeara, who got as far as the fifth grade and then just .

But of course Lennies parents knew he was dead, there was a grave where they could go and put flowers, and maybe that made it different.
Maybe not, but Abra thought it would.
Because otherwise youd pretty much have to wonder, wouldnt you?
Like when you were eating breakfast, youd wonder if your missing

was also eating breakfast somewhere, or flying a kite, or picking oranges with a bunch of migrants, or whatever.
In the back of your mind youd have to be pretty sure he or she was dead, thats what happened to most of them (you only had to watch Action News at Six to know), but you couldnt be sure."

The food was prepared by Short Eddie and Big Mo (rube names Ed and Maureen Higgins).
Neither was up to Dick Halloranns culinary standardsfew were!but its hard to screw up too badly on the things Camper People like to eat: meatloaf, macaroni and cheese, meatloaf, pancakes drenched in Log Cabin syrup, meatloaf, chicken stew, meatloaf, Tuna Surprise, and meatloaf with mushroom gravy.
After dinner, the tables were cleared for bingo or card parties.
On weekends, there were dances.
These festivities took place only when the campground was open.
This eveningas, three time zones east, Dan Torrance sat beside a dead woman and waited for his visitorthere was business of a different sort to transact in Overlook Lodge.
Jimmy Numbers was at the head of a single table that had been set up in the middle of the polished birds-eye maple floor.
His PowerBook was open, the desktop displaying a photograph of his hometown, which happened to be deep in the Carpathian Mountains.

I will.
For sure.
This, of course, was what all kids said in order to placate the adults in their lives, but it still made Dan feel better.
A little, anyway.
Besides, there was Billy in his F-150 with the faded red paint.
Her eyes were dancing again.
I found lots of stuff out.
Thats why I needed to see you.
What stuff?"

He closed his eyes.
After thirty seconds or so, he opened them again.
Youre Barry.
Youre one of the good guys.
What does that mean?
I dont know, except Im betting hes the one Abra calls Barry the Chunk.
Nothing else?
Abra will be able to get more.
Are you sure of that?"

Theyre going to stop and get a package.
It must be medicine for him.

What did you mean about cycling?
Dave asked.
I dont know.
If Barrys sick, will that stop them?

Will they maybe turn around and go back to wherever they came from?"

Billy considered.
Okay, I know a guy down in Madison.
He buys and sells bigger stuff.
Some of it much bigger.
Oh Jesus, Dave said.
This just gets worse.
But he didnt say anything else.
Dan said, Billy, could we reserve the train tomorrow, if we wanted to have a sunset picnic at Cloud Gap?"

I said I was not worthy.
He insisted that I was."

A little black mask hung from one decaying hand.
He reeked of the grave.
Great party, isnt it?
he asked.
Danny turned and walked away, very quickly.
When school was over, he called Dick long-distance at the restaurant where Dick worked in Key West.
Another one of the Overlook People found me.
How many boxes can I have, Dick?
In my head, I mean."

Then he drew in a deep breath and exhaled.
Where did you come from, little hero?
Mama, the kid said.
Which in a way made perfect senseDan, too, had come from his mamabut it didnt help.
A terrible deduction was trying to form itself in his thumping head, but he didnt want anything to do with it.
He saw you take the money.
Maybe so, but that wasnt the deduction.
If the kid saw him take it, so what?
He wasnt even two."

Around eight thirty, the snow began.
It was heavy and wet, quickly coating his window and blocking his view of the mountains.
In a way, that was worse.
The snow had blocked the windows in the Overlook, too.

The crying was monotonous, maddening, terrifying.
When they arrived at Bridgton Hospital, it was quarter of four, and Abra was still at full volume.

My i-keem!
Now tell Doctor John about Mrs. Judkins, David said.
You were there for that.
Indeed I was, Concetta said.
That was some Fourth of July weekend.

Patty Noyes came over with the coffeepot and poured Dan a cup, unasked.
How are you, handsome?
Dan grinned at her.
Im good.
She ruffled his hair, then headed back to the counter, with a little extra swing in her stride.
The men followed the sweet tick-tock of her hips, as men do, then Casey returned his gaze to Dan.
Made any progress with that God-of-my-understanding stuff?
Not much, Dan said.
Ive got an idea it may be a lifetime work."

Above them was this heading:
HAVE YOU SEEN ME?
A Weekly Service Of Your Anniston Shopper
For a moment Abra thought it was some sort of contest, like a scavenger hunt.
Then she realized these were missing children, and it was as if a hand had grasped the soft lining of her stomach and squeezed it like a washcloth.
She had bought a three-pack of Oreos in the caf at lunch, and had saved them for the bus ride home.
Now she seemed to feel them being wadded up toward her throat by that clutching hand."

Im okay.
You sure?

I never heard of her, and I hardly ever go to Anniston.
Who said Abra lives in Anniston?
Billy cocked a thumb at Dan.
He did.

Tell me about that.
Dan went through it again.
Doodling Abras name in his AA meeting book.
The first chalked hello.
His clear sense of Abras presence on the night Charlie Hayes died.
I asked if she was the little girl who sometimes wrote on my blackboard.
She didnt answer in words, but there was a little run of piano music.
Some old Beatles tune, I think.
Dave looked at John."
14,9973,valley,-0.13079760884616276,"What I really want is a double shot of Jack, but Im willing to stipulate with no input from you gentlemen that sippin whiskey might not be such a good idea tonight.
Ill get it, Dad.
Abra bounced into the kitchen.
They heard the snap of the flip-top and the hiss of the carbonationsounds that brought back memories for Dan, many of them treacherously happy.
She returned with a can of Coors and a pilsner glass.
Can I pour it?
Knock yourself out.
Dan and John watched with silent fascination as Abra tilted the glass and slid the beer down the side to minimize the foam, operating with the casual expertise of a good bartender.
She handed the glass to her father and set the can on a coaster beside him.
Dave took a deep swallow, sighed, closed his eyes, then opened them again."
15,10229,valley,-0.13664052459902018,"Im with my dad, and thats all.
Looking at herself in the mirror, Abra whispered, Hold that thought.
Jimmy Numbers was behind the wheel when they pulled into the Bretton Woods rest stop, which was quite close to Anniston, the town where the troublesome girl lived.
Only she wasnt there.
According to Barry, she was in a town called Frazier, a little further southeast.
On a picnic with her dad.
Making herself scarce.
Much good it would do her.
